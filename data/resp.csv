We can't necessarily rule out covid just yet.",Thats what I was worried about.
respiratory,"Yeah, and given that you're having difficulties breathing, we're also going to have a look at your chest and do it physical exam, but also do a chest X Ray just to make sure, or just to see if there's anything a infection that is settling in your chest, and a covid swab and then uh go from there. Weâll decide whether you need to stay in the, you need to stay in the hospital and if you can go home based on those results, but if you are to go home, we would request that you stay away from from everyone, so including your wife. Try to self isolate as much as possible and your results should come out in 24 to 48 hours and then the public health nurse should tell you what to do if your results are positive.","OK, OK no, that sounds fair,"
respiratory,"All right. Well, let's do a physical exam and then go from there.",OK. Thank you.

respiratory,"Yeah, certainly, uh, so it could possibly be something related to the heart. I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days.

respiratory,"OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you."
respiratory,"Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?","So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do."
respiratory,"OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?","Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you."

respiratory,Is your pain controlled well with Tylenol?,"Yeah, I tried to suck it up. I just don't wanna go on those other medications. I've heard like, you can get addicted to them."
respiratory,"Yeah, that's fair, that's a fair point. But it's also, I guess it's important that you move around at home. Um, so maybe try to, maybe we can increase your Tylenol dose, or maybe um, see if there's another pain med that you can be started on if you're not interested in opioids, just to make sure that you're moving around 'cause that's very important. At the hospital, did you receive an injection in your, in your tummy.","An injection in my tummy, um."

respiratory,"Okay, alright. Well given your symptoms, um, with the, with the swelling and the pain in the right calf and the difficulties breathing, it's very likely that you have um, and your recent hospitalization and hip injury, um it sounds like you might have something called, or pulmonary embolism, basically, which is a blood clot inside your lungs, and so we'll do a scan of your lungs to see what's going on. We'll also do an ultrasound of your leg, and then um, we might have to treat, uh, this with blood thinners. And we definitely have to hospitalize you, and we'll be measuring your vitals and seeing if you need any oxygen to help you out.","Okay, I'll be, I'll be here for a while then?"
respiratory,"Well, we'll keep you for a bit, at least the next couple of days until your, your breathing gets better. And you've, you've been started on anti, on blood thinners.",Okay.
respiratory,"And we can be sure that you're, you're doing okay, we'll also continuously monitor your vital signs um, to make sure that you're doing well, and then we'll make sure that you're discharged.

respiratory,"Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower.

And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."

respiratory,"Sure. Um OK, I think that's all the questions that I had for you today. So it sounds like there's probably some kind of infection going on. What it is exactly, it's hard to say. There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms.","OK, that sounds good."
respiratory,"So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing.","OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home."

respiratory,"OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?","No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?"
respiratory,"So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?","OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up."
respiratory,"Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.","OK, alright that sounds good, thank you."

respiratory,"OK. Uhm, and I guess going back to the cough, does it make it difficult for you to fall asleep at night or does it wake you up in the middle of the night?","No I, it hasn't done that."

respiratory,"Alright. Any medical conditions that run in your family, anything related to the lungs, or otherwise?","Uh, no."
respiratory,"OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?","I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think."
respiratory,OK.,"But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having."
respiratory,"Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do.","OK, yeah, that sounds good."

respiratory,"Yeah, certainly. So, I, so it's sounds like you have the common cold or a viral illness, which it could be caused by something like adenovirus or there are others as well. However, the symptoms do overlap with COVID. As you can be like nonspecific symptoms, such as having kind of just like a runny nose like you do here, and so we will do a COVID swab and we'll await those results, but in the meantime it's mostly supportive care, so it means just trying to stay hydrated, stay rested. And just monitor your symptoms because if things do get worse, it'll be important to, uh, go to the emergency room.",OK.

respiratory,"OK, so with your current symptoms right now with no cough, tonsillar exudate, a fever, also your age and the like swelling and redness that you notice in the back of your throat is likely a group a strep pharyngitis that's causing this. And with your exposure to your brother who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you were around, so this would require antibiotics as well for yourself and we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that because it it still could possibly be a viral illness and so that passes negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness then we might hold off on antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse like you start to get shortness of breath or your fever's getting worse and it's not, not being controlled, then we'll reeassess the situation.","OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."

respiratory,"I see, and um do you remember if the LDL was normal at that time?",Ah yes it was normal.

respiratory,OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike?,"Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that."

respiratory,OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?,"No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?"
respiratory,"Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.","OK great, thank you."

respiratory,"OK, and, how much phlegm would you say you're putting out like per every time you cough?","I'd say every time I cough, I'm bringing up at least a teaspoon of of the dark sputum."

respiratory,"Yeah, so this cough, um, it's been going on for the last four days. Since you do have a cough, um and right now that, like, is considered a symptom, like, like a potential symptom for COVID, we definitely want to do a COVID swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates, or family members for the next, so, 14 days since you first experienced the, the cough.",Okay.
respiratory,"Based on, like, public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions. And if, it can be anything else too, like, with a cough, there can be multiple things going on. You can have um, like an upper respiratory, viral, or bacterial infection. But since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis. Um, this is something that we'll try and keep an eye on and make sure it's nothing else like, uh pneumonia, for example.

And are you concerned about her breathing?"
respiratory,"Um, so the, the physical exam and the, the vital signs will really, will help with um, to assess her breathing and to see oxygen levels.",Yeah.
respiratory,"Um, and um, this could be uh, caused by um, a viral infection, which could be something along the lines of uh, like a common cold type picture, and we can get like inflammation of uh, really small airways, um, and it can cause that cough, and fever, and some of the symptoms that she's experiencing. And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay. And possibly, we'll need steroids and um, and uh, an inhaler if necessary.","Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you."

respiratory,"Yeah, OK, well, it's only been two days so far, let's just keep an eye on your symptoms and see how you're doing. It might also be a good idea just to get a covid swab done, and if your symptoms continue to worsen, give me a call again and we can talk about it a little bit more and see if maybe a bacterial infection or if there's something else that's going on. You don't have any difficulties breathing, do you?","No, I don't."
respiratory,"Alright, OK, alright umm, we'll do a physical exam and then chat a little bit more after.","OK, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well."
respiratory,"Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start?","So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me."
respiratory,"OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?","Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum."
respiratory,"OK, what color is your sputum?",It's mainly like clear white.
respiratory,OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?,"No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce."
respiratory,"OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?",I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well.
respiratory,OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?,"Oh no, I don't really have any pains."
respiratory,"OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?","I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath."
respiratory,OK.,"But that was, I think, two years ago."
respiratory,"OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?","Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital."
respiratory,"OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?",Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.
respiratory,"OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?",I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.
respiratory,"OK, any weight loss?",No.
respiratory,"OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes?","Umm, no."

respiratory,Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?,Nope.
respiratory,Changes to urinating?,"No, that's all fine"
respiratory,"OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?","I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol."
respiratory,"OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?","Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80."
respiratory,"Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?","Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed."
respiratory,"OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol?","I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it."
respiratory,Do you take any puffers for your COPD?,"Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to."
respiratory,OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?,"Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva."
respiratory,"OK, sure, Yep.",So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.
respiratory,"Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?","Yeah, I think so."
respiratory,And are you allergic to anything?,"No, not that I know."
respiratory,Any family history of lung conditions?,"Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so."
respiratory,OK. How about heart conditions?,"Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s."
respiratory,"OK. Alright, any cancers?",My uncle had skin cancer.
respiratory,"OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?","No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away."
respiratory,"Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?","Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years."
respiratory,"OK, how much do you smoke?",Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.
respiratory,"Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?","Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet."
respiratory,"OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol?","Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey."
respiratory,"OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?","No, no marijuana, no other drugs."
respiratory,"OK, and where do you live right now?",Right now I live in a small bungalow in London.
respiratory,"OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?","Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date."
respiratory,"OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?","No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home."
respiratory,"OK, how about travel to anywhere?","Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic."
respiratory,"Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?","Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before."
respiratory,"Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?",Thank you.
respiratory,Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?,"Yeah, absolutely. Uhm, I don't know, I've just been feeling a little feverish, uhm, and I also have a, a bit of a sore throat."

respiratory,"OK, and when did that start?",This morning.
respiratory,"OK, did you take your temperature?","No, I don't have a thermometer at home."
respiratory,"OK, and have you had any, any cough?",No.

And the sore throat was just worse and I felt feverish and tired and I felt really crappy."
respiratory,"OK, yeah, and have you had any symptoms like this before?","Well yeah, I usually get a cold once a year in the fall. It does feel similar to that."
respiratory,OK.,"But I still wanted to be careful and come in, just in case."

respiratory,"Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?","No, I haven't."
respiratory,"OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin.",Sure.

So just wondering if he would need to be hospitalized again and if he needs antibiotics."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure it's, it's been uhm, so it's been three or four days, but with a fever this high and his symptoms, with uh, having obstruction, discharge, uhm, changes to smell or loss of smell it does sound like it could be bacterial and so I think it would be reasonable to possibly to start antibiotics in this case, but we'll go through, through a physical exam, check some vitals and go from there.","Ok, Ok, sounds good, thank you."

respiratory,"Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing.

Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted.","Okay. Okay yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
respiratory,So what brings you in here today?,"Hi, um so I've been very I've been, I haven't been feeling very well for the past four days. I've, I've been having chills. I am feeling short of breath and now my chest hurts."
respiratory,"Okay, I'm sorry. Um so how long, like can you just tell me what started first and when did this all kind of start?","So, what started first?

respiratory,"Okay, and uh, where would you say you're getting the chest pain?","Um, it's mostly like centre of my chest, like, close to my, like I'd say it's like it feels like, it's not my like, it doesn't feel like it's inside. It feels more like it's pushing up on, on my chest wall."

respiratory,"Okay, and um yeah, so those were kind of, all the questions that I had today. Do you have any concerns or questions?","Um, yeah like what, do you think I have COVID?"
respiratory,"Yeah so, right now it's definitely something that's on everyone's mind. Um some of these symptoms, um the shortness of breath and fever, definitely can be COVID, and that's something that we are going to test you with, and that's something we test everyone with. Um, but because you're having shortness of breath, uh, we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well. Uh you can potentially have pneumonia that's not COVID, it can be any other virus or bacteria, so we will get some blood work done, we'll get your temperature and all your vitals taken as well, um and then get a chest x-ray as well.",Okay.
respiratory,"And if it turns out at all that you have pneumonia, we'll just reassess and see if you need to stay in the hospital for longer, if you need any antibiotics within the hospital, or you can take them at home. So yeah, we'll do a full physical examination and do all those tests and then go from there.","Okay, that sounds great. Thank you."

Can you describe it?","Yeah, I just feel like um, I'm getting out of breath really easily, just like um, walking even, walking to the kitchen from my bedroom, I'm getting short of breath and it, it just started yesterday morning, it's so odd."
respiratory,"Okay, and have you had anything like this happen before to you?",No.
respiratory,"No. Were you doing anything before it started? Like were you doing any, any activities or any, are were you doing any exertions at all?","No, I was just uh, I, I slept in, I slept in a bit more than usual, um, and I was feeling quite um, drowsy. My, my doc increased my pain meds and I took the first dose um, yesterday night, um, I actually took an extra pill um, um, of the morphine um, and yeah, I don't know, maybe it, it's an allergic reaction to the morphine."
respiratory,Have you had any allergic reactions before?,No.
respiratory,"And so you took an extra morphine last night and then went to sleep. Um, did you wake up coughing or catching your breath or anything like that?","No, I actually, I ended up waking up at 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM, I was just very drowsy and uh, I think I, I think I might have taken a bit too much, I don't know.

respiratory,Any family history of any lung or heart conditions?,Uh no.

respiratory,"Um, any, alright, so I think that those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?","Um, no."
respiratory,"Okay, so yeah, definitely with the coughing and shortness of breath we will definitely get a COVID swab test done. Um, that should come back in the next 24 to 48 hours and then public health will contact you. Um, yeah, based on what you're telling me so far, we will definitely do a physical examination, get your vitals, and get your oxygenation and everything done. But I also think, since you were very drowsy and were, had fallen asleep and were really difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia. Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today. Um, now we may require antibiotics, and if your vitals unstable we might actually admit you as well. Um, does that sound good?",Yeah.
respiratory,"Alright, so yeah, we'll get those tests done and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get like an EKG done as well.",Sure.
respiratory,What brings you in today?,"Uh, yeah, so I, I just came in because I've been having, for the last, I would say 2 weeks, just a lot of congestion in my nose and then I've also been feeling a lot of pressure in my head as well as just, around my jaws and my face overall."
respiratory,"Okay, and um, you said it started two weeks ago. Has it gotten better or worse, or been the same since then?","Um, I'd say it's pretty much been the same, except like the pressure's getting worse."
respiratory,"Okay, and do you find that the pressure is worse when you're bending down, or um, yeah, when you're like squatting or sitting down?","Um, when I'm sitting down, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel like, for example, when I'm lying on one side, it gets really bad on that one side and I have to kind of switch over to the other side."
respiratory,"Okay, alright. And uh, when did your headaches start?","Um it's, I guess it's not so much as a headache as just kind of um, just pain in and around the cheeks and just going up to my head. And it started about, I would say around 2 weeks ago."
respiratory,"Um, and do you have a stuffy nose?","Yeah, I definitely have a stuffy nose and it started, um, it sometimes gets like, like a runny nose as well."

respiratory,"Okay. Um, alright so, have you had any contact with anyone who could have been sick in the past two weeks or before that?","No, no, I'm very like careful. Um, I barely go out."
respiratory,"Good, that's very good. Um are you, have you traveled anywhere outside the province?",No.
respiratory,"Okay and um, do you currently work?","I work from home right now, um, I'm an accountant."
respiratory,"Okay and do you live with anyone else, or do you live alone?","Uh, so I live with my family. I live with my husband and um two daughters."
respiratory,Have any of them been sick recently?,"No, they've been fine."
respiratory,"Okay, good. Um, and do you smoke?","No, not at all."
respiratory,Do you smoke marijuana or consume any recreational drugs?,"Probably the last time was in college, um for marijuana."
respiratory,"I see. Um, what about alcohol?","Alcohol, I'll probably have a glass of red wine a day."
respiratory,"Alright, okay. And um, have you, do you have any, um I guess carpets or, or um curtains or any sort of animals around, anything that might cause any kind of environmental allergies?","Uh no, nothing like that."
respiratory,"Okay, um alright. And do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?","No, I've been completely healthy."
respiratory,Any hospitalizations or surgeries?,"I did have a, um, c-section with both my, both my children."
respiratory,I see. Any complications after?,"No complications after. They were both healthy, I, I didn't have to stay in the hospital."
respiratory,"Great, great. Um and any allergies uh to medications, foods or environmental allergies?","Nope, not that I know of."
respiratory,"Any medications, including over the counter herbal medications?","I have uh, I do take uh, Tylenol cold in bed sometimes, to relieve some of the pain and pressure."
respiratory,"That's good, that's good. Is there anything else that makes the the pressure and the pain better?","Um, I have done those like, kind of those steam um, therapies. That sometimes helps."
respiratory,"Okay good, good, good. Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?","Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it."
respiratory,"Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?","Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything."
respiratory,What about sense of taste?,"Um taste, I guess, like with the smell gone sometimes like the taste feels weird too, but like not, not really."
respiratory,"I see, okay. Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?","Um my, my father did have a heart attack in his uh, I think it was late 50s, but he's well and alive right now, so he's fine."
respiratory,"Good. Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do.",Okay.
respiratory,Do you have any questions for me?,"Uh no, that's all. Thank you so much."
respiratory,How can I help you?,"Hi, my son Dave who's 5 years old, who comes to the clinic quite often, has uh, his asthma has been really bad over the past few days. I've tried his puffers, but they're not really helping much, and I'm just worried about him."
respiratory,So what symptom is he experiencing now?,"Uhm so, he's just having this wheezing that just doesn't go away, like, I can actually hear it, it's frightening, he's having like he's having difficulties falling asleep, he's just been very irritable, uhm, he didn't go to school yesterday. It's just, yeah, it's just, it seems like, it's just, he's not eating well either."
respiratory,"OK, so yeah, it's been affecting, uh, sleep, appetite, his mood, has he been short of breath?","If he was like, he said that he was having some difficulty breathing, yeah."
respiratory,"OK, has he, uh, able to talk like in full sentences, like, how is he right now?","Yeah, he's  able to talk in full sentences but he just gets a little bit breathless when he's eating, which I think is probably why he's not eating much. But yeah, he's able to talk, he's not talking much either, just been like, just been in a mood, you know, he gets a little bit breathless when he's crying."

respiratory,"Alright, and has he had any muscle aches or joint pains?","Uh, he's just been, he's just been not, he's not been as active as he usually is, so I don't, he hasn't said that any anything in particular about muscle pains, but I don't know if he knows how to, you know? He's just been, yeah."
respiratory,"OK, and two days ago, can you think of any triggers like, was there any exposure to dust or smoke or maybe even pets that could have brought this on?","Yeah, you know, if I think about it, he did go outside to play with his brother and, I don't know he might have got something out there maybe."

respiratory,"And when, like, during the winter time, does cold air trigger attacks for Dave?",Oh yeah.

respiratory,"OK, and do you use a spacer?","Uhm, no we don't. I have to go get that and learn how to use it."
respiratory,"OK, for sure we can go through, Uh, the proper technique, throughout this visit as well, just to review that again.",I would love that.
respiratory,"That's great, and has he been using any other medications to help over these last couple of days besides the inhalers?","No, just the inhalers, we've also kept it the usual one, the one that he takes, the other inhaler."
respiratory,"OK, does he have one that he uses, once, like, he uses daily?","Yeah, yeah the one that he uses, I think the orange one."

respiratory,"OK, and in regards to birth history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy or with delivery?","Oh no, everything was normal. He was born via vaginal delivery and no complications. He was a healthy baby."
respiratory,"OK, and have you had any concerns with growth or developmental milestones?","No, no, the doc was pretty happy when he did the regular, the checkup and yeah things are good with him, he's a good kid."
respiratory,"Awesome, OK, and could you tell me a little bit about the living situation, like who's the main caregiver and who he's living with?","Yeah, so he lives with me, his dad and his brother who is 2 years older and he's not going to school right now. We're just keeping him at home due to Covid and trying to do some home schooling. I'm a homemaker, so I do have enough time to spend time with him and his older brother and, yeah."
respiratory,"OK, has anybody in the home been sick, either his brother, yourself, or father?","Uh, no."

respiratory,"For sure, yeah, we'll, uh, check his his vital signs and do a physical exam. And it does sound like it could be an asthma exacerbation, and so we can trial some inhaler medications, a little bit different than what you use at home. But also using Ventolin as well and we'll assess the need for potential, uh, antibiotics and also steroid if necessary and if his breathing gets worse or you're starting to hear that the wheezing is getting worse or his work of breathing is becoming more intense then certainly we'll need to add on some oxygen and possibly, some other therapies.",Thank you so much doc.

But it's, uh, and then, uh, also we'll get some blood work and a chest x-ray. But it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation. Which, so some of the shortness of breath, it could be coming from fluid, uhm, that has accumulated in your lungs and so, uh, we'll give you, oh, another type of water pill now, Furosemide, to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing.

respiratory,"OK, any reasons to think you have old carpet mold or asbestos?","No, it's a fairly new apartment."
respiratory,"OK, and well those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions for me?",You don't think it could be COVID right? Like my wife got tested and it was negative.
respiratory,Are you concerned about that?,"Yeah, for sure."
respiratory,"Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?","OK, great. Thank you."
respiratory,How may I help you?,"Hi, yes it's nice to meet you. I've been having this cough that's been going on for the last few days and I have had difficulty breathing."
respiratory,"Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?","Oh, so the cough started about 3 days ago. Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then."
respiratory,"OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?","Yeah, not really. Actually, it's been well, but just bad after I cough."
respiratory,So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?,"Not really, I've been able to do the same amounts of of activity I guess."
respiratory,"OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?","I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly."
respiratory,"OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?",It's dry. It's a dry cough.
respiratory,"OK, and there's no sputum production with it? Anything coming up at all?","No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
respiratory,"OK, and is there anything that's making the cough better? Did you take anything? Any medications for it?",I tried some over the counter stuff but it didn't help.
respiratory,"OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?","Yeah, I've been really tired. I guess I've just sort of been  resting the these last few days and I've had a headache as well."
respiratory,OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?,"Yeah, it feels like somebody is just squeezing the top of or just squeezing the sides of my head."
respiratory,Have you had a headache like this before?,"I have, yeah. I usually get them when I'm dehydrated. Or maybe I haven't slept well. And that's also been the case for the past two to three days. Yeah, it's been kind of off and on, there are some times that are worse than others, but I've noticed that I had it for the most part for the last few days, OK,"
respiratory,Have you taken anything for your headache? Any pain meds?,"Yeah, I've been taking some Advil, it's helped."
respiratory,"And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?","Yes, I would say, but both the cough and the shortness of breath has been getting worse over these last few days."
respiratory,"OK, and have you had any chills or have you checked your temperature?","I haven't checked my temperature, but I felt like I've had a fever or might be getting a fever."
respiratory,We can check your temperature here. And have you had any muscle aches?,"Yeah, I guess I felt a bit achy."
respiratory,Any redness in the eyes? Or any runny nose or sore throat like flu-like symptoms?,"Umm, I have, I don't know maybe my nose is a little bit congested, but not really running."
respiratory,OK. And have you had any change in your sense of smell?,"No, I haven't noticed that."
respiratory,What about your sense of taste? Are you able to taste things?,"Yeah, I think so."
respiratory,Have you noticed any rash anywhere on your body?,"Umm, no,  I haven't."
respiratory,"OK, any changes in your bowel movement, diarrhea or constipation?","No, no, nothing like that."
respiratory,Any chest pain?,"No, I haven't had any."
respiratory,"OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?","No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything."
respiratory,"OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?","Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think."
respiratory,"Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?","No, I haven't had any issues with like asthma attacks in a long time."
respiratory,Do you have an inhaler?,I do but I don't use it very often.
respiratory,"I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?",Yeah I did try it and it didn't really seem to help that much.
respiratory,"Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?","Uh, I had a colonoscopy two years ago."
respiratory,Any reason for that?,"Uhh, my father had colon cancer when he was in his 60s."
respiratory,"I see OK, and any hospitalizations?",No.

respiratory,"Alright, sounds good, and have you had any contact with any sick people? Anyone who's sick recently?","Not that I know of. I mean, I went to a few stores here and there that I had been going to. I've been working from home so maybe at one of the stores. And I would imagine I were wearing a mask and of course trying to maintain social distancing as much as possible. But yeah, you never, really know."
respiratory,What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?,"Umm, no, I had been at home."
respiratory,Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you. Does that sound good to you?,"Yeah, that sounds great."
respiratory,What brings you all in today?,"Essentially, when he, so today is Friday, when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he, I don't know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick, so he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Um and then, yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, or sorry it's today, today is Friday, um, he was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today. What was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember. It was it was, it was like over 100 though."
respiratory,Oh OK.,"101 or something or maybe 100.1. But anyways, it was, so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something."
respiratory,"Yeah for sure. Um, OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five 5 days.",Mhmm.

respiratory,No go ahead.,"So I just wanted to basically see if it was that and I mean he does receive you're so scared. That's kind of what made me come in, like it's scaring me a little bit."
respiratory,"Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back. How does that sound?","Yeah, sounds good."
respiratory,OK great.,Thank you.
respiratory,"Yeah, no worries. Uhm and I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things","OK yeah, that's good to know."

It's a, it's a fairly small room, so."
respiratory,"Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.

respiratory,"We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that.

Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health.

respiratory,"No, this is the first time, okay. Um, any so, she, she is vomiting. Um, is the vomit like green in colour? Or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten? What's the content of the moment?",It's usually just what she's eaten.
respiratory,"Okay, um, any sick contacts recently or any travel?","No, I don't think so. Not, nothing really."
respiratory,"Um, and how about her behaviour? Does she seem like uh, very tired or fatigued, or more irritable?","She does get tired, especially after, and then she's irritable and crying after, you know, she has these fits of coughs."
respiratory,Okay.,Yeah.
respiratory,"Okay. Um, any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation?",No.
respiratory,"Okay. Any um, any trouble with urinating at all?",No.
respiratory,No. How's her sleeping like?,"Uh, not great. It's just the cough keeps uh, waking her up and she just doesn't, can't fall asleep."
respiratory,"Okay, any uh, exposure to dust or fumes, or animals or pets at home?","We, we did get a cat um, about a month ago."
respiratory,"Okay. Um, and any, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?",No.
respiratory,"Um, and any allergies that you know of?","Um, no."
respiratory,"And um, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?",No.
respiratory,"And how was your pregnancy, your pregnancy with her, like any complications at all?","No, no complications. It was uh, it was very, yeah, it went well."
respiratory,And was she at term or premature?,"She was at term, she was born at term."
respiratory,"Was it a vaginal delivery or uh, a c-section?","Uh, vaginal."

respiratory,"Okay. And in terms of her milestones, has she been meeting all of them on time?",Yes.
respiratory,"Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?","Uh, no."
respiratory,"Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?","Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that."
respiratory,And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?,"Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those."
respiratory,"Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child.","Okay, I'll think about it."
respiratory,"Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?",Sure.
respiratory,How may I help you?,"Hi, um, I'm here because I, I had this cough for a couple days and now my voice still hasn't recovered. It sounds really hoarse and I can't speak as well, so I was just wondering if you can give me something for that."
respiratory,"Possibly we will see just gotta ask a few questions first, and we'll, we'll do a physical exam as well afterwards, but certainly, we'll look into what is causing your symptoms. So you mentioned a cough. When did that exactly start?",That started three days ago.
respiratory,"Okay, and have you had a cough before?","Um, like before the three days you mean?"
respiratory,Yeah.,"Um, no, I was pretty healthy before then."
respiratory,"I see and uh, with the cough, are you producing any phlegm or sputum?","No, it's pretty dry."

respiratory,"Alright, and have you had any uh, chest pain with the cough?",No.
respiratory,"Alright uh, and you noticed that your voice is, voice changed, and that was about 3 days ago as well?","Yeah, that, so, well no, actually that started about yesterday. Yeah, yesterday in the afternoon."
respiratory,"Okay, and uh, any triggers for this? Like were you at any events that you had to be uh, kind of speaking loudly or talking a lot or anything where you're straining your voice?","Um no, no, I wasn't. I was like, I had school, I came home, I didn't do anything like that."
respiratory,"Okay. Yeah, so it sounds, yeah, just sort of came on on its own. Alright, and have you had any like, eye redness, or discharge, or a runny nose?","I have had uh, I've had a runny nose before, but no eye discharge."
respiratory,"Okay. With the runny nose, what, what, what could you describe the uh, mucus that was coming out?","Uh, it was, it was clear."
respiratory,And has that gone away now and then when was the runny nose?,"Yeah, that's gone, yeah that's gone. That went away but like, um, yeah, two days ago maybe."
respiratory,"I see, and have you had a sore throat or do you have a sore throat?","Um I have, so, it hurts because I'm coughing, but it doesn't seem like it's my actual throat."
respiratory,"Alright, is there any pain with swallowing food or liquids?",No.
respiratory,"Okay. Um, and have you had any fevers or chills?",No.
respiratory,"Or any, any night sweats?",No.
respiratory,And any changes to your weight recently?,"Um, I've had some weight gain over the past like six months."
respiratory,"Okay, well that's great. And about how much?","Uh just, maybe like 5, 10 pounds. 5 to 10 pounds, somewhere around there."
respiratory,"Okay, well that's good. And um, have you had any nausea or vomiting?",No.
respiratory,How about any abdominal pain?,Uh no.
respiratory,"Any uh, diarrhea?",No.
respiratory,Or any urinary problems?,No.
respiratory,"Have you had any muscle aches or, or joint pains?","Uh, no."
respiratory,"Okay, and have you had any loss of your taste or sense of smell?",No.
respiratory,"Okay, um, and any skin changes or rashes?","Nope, nothing like that."
respiratory,"Okay, uh, and um, so you've been experiencing, so you had a runny nose that's gone away um, and now you've been having this cough for the past, dry cough, past three days and lost your voice yesterday. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?","Um no, no other symptoms."
respiratory,"Alright, in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?","Uh no, I've been pretty healthy."
respiratory,"That's great, and u, have you been, um, have you had any allergies before?",No.
respiratory,"Okay, and uh, do you take any medications regularly?","Uh, I just take some multivitamins."
respiratory,"Okay, and uh are you aware if your immunizations are up to date?","Uh, so I have everything except for that HPV vaccine."
respiratory,"Okay, um, is it, do you have a plan to get that one or?","I think so. I'm just uh, waiting to follow up with my family doctor about that."
respiratory,"Okay, well that, that's a good idea for sure. So it's great that you have a plan for that, um, for that. Yeah, it can be really helpful for preventing cervical cancer, as, as I'm sure you'll talk to the, with the family doctor about. Yeah, and have you had any hospitalizations or any surgeries?",Uh no.
respiratory,"Okay, um, where about are you living right now, and who are living with?","I live uh, with my parents um, and my two younger siblings. We live in a house."
respiratory,Has anybody else been sick or have similar symptoms?,"Uh no, no one at home's been sick."
respiratory,"Okay, and uh, how about anybody at school or, or work, or anything like that that you've been around who's been sick?","So one of my friends actually had like a runny nose and a cough as well a couple of days ago, but uh, she seems to be better now and her voice is okay."
respiratory,"Okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere outside of the city or province?","No, no, not recently."
respiratory,"Alright, and, um, in the home, is there any uh like, are you exposed to any violence of any sort, like physical or emotional, either yourself or, or witnessing?",No.
respiratory,"Okay, and what grade are you in?","I'm in grade 7 or, yeah grade 7 now."
respiratory,"Oh awesome, and uh, I don't, is there any smoking in the home?","Uh no, no one smokes at home."
respiratory,"Okay um, and then, um, anybody in the family uh, have any heart or lung conditions?","Heart or lung? I know, um, like, heart disease, runs on my father's side of the family. I'm not really sure like exactly what, what kind of diseases though."
respiratory,"Okay, um, and I, sometimes people that, kind of in this age group, might experience with either drugs or alcohol. Have any of your friends done that or, or yourself?","I know like some of my friends have uh, tried alcohol and try marijuana, but I haven't experimented yet."
respiratory,"Okay, that's good and um, I, that's all I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to add?","Oh, nothing that I want to add. I just, what do you, how do you think I can make this, make my voice better? And how long will I have, have this horse voice?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?","Uh no, I haven't."
respiratory,"Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness.",Okay.
respiratory,"Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there.","Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in here today?,"Hi, I've I've just been. I've been sneezing a lot and I have this runny nose. It's just been very irritating. I kind of want to do something about it. I've had it for awhile, but it's just. You know, I decided to like, come in to find out what's. What's wrong with me? Why do I like? Why does this happen to me? All my friends are OK."

respiratory,"Well, it's really great that you're, you know, trying to lose weight and dieting and and having like a healthier lifestyle. It is definitely harder with the pandemic going on right now to to get in the activities. And it's hard like being at home, and sometimes it's really difficult to like not eat right",Yeah yeah true.
respiratory,"So besides besides that any kind of recent exposures to any fumes, dust, animals, pets like anything like that?","Yeah, it was kind of like vacuuming a couple of days ago when it got really bad, but nothing. Not not. I don't think there's not been any other exposures."
respiratory,"OK. And do you have any past medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with like asthma, eczema, anything like that?","I haven't been diagnosed with anything. No. I did have like I know that I would sometimes get kind of short of breath as a child. But my mom doesn't really trust doctors, so she wouldn't take me to one."
respiratory,"OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?","I must have been like 8 years old or 9 years old that I remember, but I think I've had it before that as well as my mom tells me."

respiratory,"Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?",yeah
respiratory,"Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist",sure.
respiratory,"And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction.",Sure
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Hi Faiha, I've been very concerned lately.

respiratory,"Pretty homebound, OK, alright, well that's good and those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?","Yeah, I don't know, what do you think is causing all of this?"
respiratory,"Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related.","OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?"
respiratory,"Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah.","OK, sounds good.Thank you."

respiratory,"Yeah, So what, uh, some of your symptoms are concerning, especially the coughing up blood, which is something that we always think of with tuberculosis. You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if",OK
respiratory,"So those are, those are some of the things that we'll get started with. Is that OK with you? Any questions or concerns?","Uhm, no nothing like that, uhm do I need to isolate?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so we will keep you in an isolated room right now, when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have TB, you will need to isolate, uhm, and stay away from contacts, not be at work, we will, if you do in fact have TB, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on a ,like antibiotic therapy, uh, which consists of like four different medications and people with the active TB will do have to isolate during that time period, so yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and, we'll get back to you as soon as possible.","OK, great, thank you."

respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. It's a good thing that you brought him in. So the cough, is it consistent? Or does it come and go?","It seems to be a little bit worse at night. He'll have this cough during the day. Sometimes I'll notice when he's playing. He's had these coughing fits that last for up to a minute but usually recovers from. He hasn't been too active to be honest. He's been a little bit slowed down these last couple of days, but in regards to consistency, I'd say it's a little bit worse at night."
respiratory,"OK, any other triggers like dust or the cold air? Anything like that?","I haven't really noticed anything. We've been mainly keeping inside due to covid, right? I think my wife left a window open the other night, and maybe the cough was a little bit better. I'm not sure. It's kind of hard to tell when we sleep."
respiratory,"Yeah, have you tried anything for it, like have you given him any over the counter cough medications?","No, we're a little scared to give him anything. He's so young. He's 2 1/2. We haven't been really giving him any medications to be honest."
respiratory,"OK, good. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's barky? Is it harsh?","Barky might be a good word to describe it, like he's had colds before his coughs were quiet but this sounds harsh. It sounds like he's really trying to cough hard there. Very violent sometimes."
respiratory,OK OK. And has he ever had a cough like this in the past?,"No, never."
respiratory,"OK, and then in terms of the timeline, is it getting worse? His cough?","I think it has been to be honest. He was a little ill like he had a runny nose a couple of days ago, maybe two days ago and then the cough started but it only really started getting noticeably different about the night of the first day, about two days ago so. Now it's been more present I suppose,than it was when he just first had it."
respiratory,"OK, and is it a dry cough or does he bring up sputum?","Sputum like phlegm,no he doesn't bring anything up really, so dry."
respiratory,OK so no blood as well right?,No blood.
respiratory,"OK,  does he have any shortness of breath with his cough?","I feel like when he has the coughing fits, he's winded. He's weak after them. Sometimes he cries after them or before the middle can be a trigger for it, but just resting normally, he doesn't seem that out of breath, no."
respiratory,OK any wheeziness?,"No, not really. He's able to breathe. I can't really hear him breathing that much. Sometimes at night after a bad cough he'll be really winded. And yeah, it does sound like a little different when he's breathing, but just right now he sounds normal."
respiratory,"OK, and any reason for you to think he has chest pain?","He hasn't any sort of chest pain. He says his throat hurts, but I don't think it's his chest."
respiratory,"Any change in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?","No, no rashes."
respiratory,How about weight loss?,"No weight loss, he's a fairly healthy kid."
respiratory,And his vision and hearing are normal?,"You know, I haven't gotten him formally assessed yet, but seems to be able to read pretty well from a distance. He's not in school yet, but I haven't noticed anything, and he can hear fine. I think he responds when I call."
respiratory,"OK, has he had a stuffy or runny nose?","Yeah yeah, that's kind of how it first started three days ago. Maybe had a runny nose. OK, yeah."
respiratory,Does he still have a runny nose?,"Umm, a little bit less now. No, not as much now."
respiratory,"OK. And his taste, any reason to believe there are any changes there?","Well, we've been kind of spoiling him a bit, just giving him ice cream. His throat hurts a little bit and he seems to still like it, so it's hard to tell."
respiratory,"OK, so he has a little bit of a sore throat as well?",Yeah.
respiratory,"OK OK, and then any dizziness or fainting spells that you've noticed?","No fainting or dizzy spells, but he's really gassed after he has like a coughing fit and he doesn't want to stand up, he'll just be sitting down or he wants to be held."
respiratory,"OK, is he more irritable than usual?","Yeah after he has a bad coughing fit, he wants to be soothed and he'll be crying, but it's just more of because he's worn out, I believe he's tired."
respiratory,"Yeah, OK, and then any confusion or memory loss?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and then in terms of his bowel movements, have things been normal from that standpoint?","Oh yeah, process of potty training him, but no, no real changes."
respiratory,"OK, so no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?",No.
respiratory,OK and he's passing gas?,OK yeah I'd say so.
respiratory,Any nausea or vomiting?,"No. We haven't been really feeding him solid meals, it's because he's been sick, we've been trying to give him soup and liquids for the most part because his throat hurts, but he's able to keep them down. So no, no nausea, no vomiting."
respiratory,"OK, and then how about changes in his appetite?","Yeah, he's not eating as much but still, we're trying to force food into him to keep his energy up. Most of time he always will be asking for snacks in the afternoon, but now not so much."
respiratory,OK. Alright and any anything else that I missed that he's been experiencing over the past few days?,"No, just the cough."
respiratory,"OK, and then he otherwise healthy? Does he have any longstanding medical conditions?","No longstanding medical conditions. Yeah, nothing really. We had a little bit of stay in the NICU, just because he was a little bit underweight, but no, nothing really."
respiratory,OK. And then his mother's pregnancy with him? Any complications at that point?,Yeah he's a little pre term. 34 weeks I think.
respiratory,"OK, was he also underweight too?  You mentioned just a little bit.",Yeah.
respiratory,"OK, and any complications during the actual delivery?","Yeah, not that I remember like she started going to labor early, like earlier than we expected. We thought it was just a regular contraction and that it will just resolve but she wound up proceeding when we showed up at the hospital"
respiratory,"OK and then in terms of growth, weight and head circumference, has he been hitting all those milestones for the past 2 1/2 years?","Yeah, we we bring him to the family doctor every couple of month for his regular checkups and nothing has been brought up to be concerning for his vaccines. He has been doing well."
respiratory,"OK and then how about other milestones like speech, movement, fine movement, all of that, like have those been normal? Is he on par with his peers?","Yeah, this is our first kid, but compared to his cousins he seems to be doing well. He's speaking, he's got little sentences, now he has good eye contact. He's a good kid."
respiratory,"OK, good good. Any hospitalizations or surgeries aside from when he was born?",No no.
respiratory,OK good and is he on any medications?,"No, OK we give him like a flintstone gummy."
respiratory,"OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?",Yeah.
respiratory,Any allergies?,Not that we know of.
respiratory,Any family history of lung conditions?,"So my grandfather, so his greatgrandfather I suppose passed away from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker though. On my mom's side there's some breast cancer. No,  nothing really that comes to mind for lungs."
respiratory,And any heart conditions?,"No, not that we know of."
respiratory,And how about other cancers?,"No, not that I know of."
respiratory,"OK, how about asthma, eczema or allergies in the family?","You know, I think my sister is allergic to peas, but she was never sick from them like go to the hospital.  I don't think there are any allergies in the family."
respiratory,"OK, good, has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?","You know, like 5 days ago we had a playdate with his cousin. And we kind of thought that that's where he got the cold from. Like the runny nose, but it just turned weird, you know."
respiratory,OK and how's this cousin doing?,"Last time I talked to Charlotte, Hank seems to be doing well so."
respiratory,"Alright, and has he traveled to anywhere recently? Have you any of you traveled anywhere recently?","No, with covid and everything, we have just been keeping to ourselves."
respiratory,And with who and where does he live?,He lives with me and his mother in a house
respiratory,OK. Any old carpets or mold or concerns for asbestos? Anything like that at home?,I don't know when this house is built. I don't think there's any asbestos in it and it's all hardwood. So no.
respiratory,"OK, good. Anyone at home smoke?","No, no."
respiratory,"OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me?","No, no that's it, no."
respiratory,"OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any","A little scary. Sounds good. OK, I'll just keep an eye on him for the next five days."
respiratory,Give us a call if his symptoms are becoming worse or if they're not resolving and we will try to do an assessment on him. Of course we will do a physical exam today and will let you know how severe his symptoms are. Most children will get over their infection on their own and he likely won't need any additional treatments.,"OK, sounds good."
respiratory,Alright take care.,Thank you.
respiratory,Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?,"Sure, my 5 year old daughter, I noticed that she's been coughing a lot over the past two days. She sounds like she has a stuffy nose and now she's got this pink eye so I just wanted to get it checked out by you."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. So the cough started 5 days ago?",Two days ago.
respiratory,OK and is the cough barky or harsh sounding?,"Yes, it sounds harsh."
respiratory,"OK, alright was there anything that changed two days ago that might have triggered the cough?","I don't think so, although she does go to daycare."

respiratory,"No. OK, uh, and how about any itchiness in the eyes?",She's been rubbing it and so it's possibly itchy.
respiratory,OK. And have you noticed any mucus coming out?,"Umm, no, it's actually stuffy."
respiratory,OK,"Yeah, not so much mucous."
respiratory,"OK, has she mentioned anything about losing smell?",No.
respiratory,"OK, umm and has she mentioned anything about being congested?",She just sounds like she's congested.

respiratory,"OK, and you say you haven't traveled anywhere?","Oh no, no, not recently."
respiratory,OK. And any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?,No.
respiratory,"OK, and how about any genetic conditions or congenital conditions in the family?","No, none, none that I know of."
respiratory,"OK, so the main symptoms are the cough that started two days ago and also you've noticed she's been congested. And sorry, what was the last symptom?",She has this pink eye and she has a cough.
respiratory,"Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing.","That sounds great, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in?,I've had this cough that started four days ago uh that that's been getting worse and um just started having some some diarrhea yesterday as well.

respiratory,"OK. Um, those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any concerns, any questions, anything that you wanted to discuss that I uh possibly missed today?","Uh nope, that was that was everything then, thank you."
respiratory,"OK, no problem, So we'll, what we'll do is we'll get a covid swab on you just because your symptoms do overlap with those of covid, um so we want to make sure that that's not what you have, so we'll take a swab. You will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um but in the meantime, you still should isolate for 14 days, and that includes trying to isolate from your family members as well when, when possible, and uh public health will be in touch to let you know uh to do some contact tracing. If it's not covid, you you could possibly have um some sort of other viral infection that's going around these days. Um how does that sound?","Yeah, it sounds great. Thank you."
respiratory,"Uh, what brings you in here today?","Uhm, so I've had this runny nose, well first it was a stuffy nose, but now I've had this runny nose for the past week and a half and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. So I was just wondering if you could give me something for that?"

respiratory,"OK, and is there anything that you have tried that has helped you with these symptoms? Any over the counter medications?","No, I haven't tried anything. I've been thinking about using some nasal decongestion but I don't want to make my runny nose any worse."
respiratory,"Yeah, no, that's a, that's a fair point. And yeah, there's multiple things that you can try over the counter, but we can get into that more later. Are you having any other symptoms at all, like any, shortness of breath, chest pain, any kind of dizziness, anything like that?","No dizziness, I feel like sometimes I have a headache though, because I feel like there's a lot of fluid or something backed up into my sinuses."
respiratory,"OK, so do you, are you feeling, that pressure in your face at all?","Mhm, a little bit, yeah."
respiratory,OK. Have you at all in the past couple weeks to a month had contact with anyone that was sick?,"No, nothing like that, that I can think of."
respiratory,OK and any travel?,"Uhm, no."
respiratory,"OK, and any symptoms of a loss of taste of, sorry, loss of sense of taste or smell?",No.
respiratory,"No, any nausea or vomiting?","Uh, nope."
respiratory,Any night sweats?,No.
respiratory,"How about fatigue, or do you feel tired?","A little bit, yeah."
respiratory,"OK, are you, do you work at all?",I work from home right now.

respiratory,"OK, uhm, where, where do you live? Do you live in an apartment, a house?",I live in an apartment.

respiratory,"OK. And yeah, those are pretty much all the questions I have right now. Do you have any questions?","Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?","Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much."
respiratory,"You're welcome, take care.",You too.
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I just brought my son, went to the hospital. I've just been getting very concerned because he's making like these, like grunting noises for the last day and, like it's it's really worrying me, I don't know if he's like not breathing and I also just did like a temperature on him just this morning and it came up to like like a high 38, so I don't know what's going on, and then he's just very like irritable and just not himself I think."
respiratory,"OK, so all of this started a day ago, you mentioned?","Yeah, it started yesterday, but the grunting started today, like, I think he was a bit on the warmer side last night as well, more irritable last night, but the grunting started this morning."
respiratory,"OK, Uhm, and you mentioned his fever was 38, correct?","Yeah, I think it was like 38, 7 or something like that."
respiratory,OK is he coughing at all?,"Uhm, yeah, I would say with the grunting there is some coughing in between as well."
respiratory,"OK, and is he bringing up any phlegm?","Uhm, he's been having some spit ups as well. They're mainly like clear and whitish, but yeah I don't know if he's bringing anything else up. There's no green or yellow material though."
respiratory,"OK, any blood in there?","No, I haven't notice any blood."
respiratory,Does he sound wheezy?,"Uh no, it's mainly just the grunting."
respiratory,"OK, OK, does he look swollen to you?","Uh, swollen as in just, uh, like in his."
respiratory,"In his, uh, like uh, legs, arms or belly area.","No, I don't think so."
respiratory,"No ok, and uh, does he have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?","No, I don't think so."
respiratory,"No, OK, how is his feeding?","Yeah, it's it's been difficult. So right now, like his mom is at home, but she was having difficulty feeding. He's mainly breastfed right now."
respiratory,OK.,And he's not really been feeding too much either.
respiratory,"OK, and how about like the number of wet diapers he has?","Just the normal like, that hasn't changed. He has like three or four in a day."
respiratory,"OK, OK, good. Have you noticed any changes to his bowel movements or urine?","No, pretty much been the same."
respiratory,"OK, is he throwing up at all?","Nope, just some spit ups, I don't know if that's, Just because of the coughing or if they're just spit ups, like, but nothing after eating."
respiratory,"OK, OK, have you noticed any rashes on him?","No, no rashes."
respiratory,"OK, uhm, has he had any fainting spells or seizures?","Uh, no, I've been really trying to make sure, like, I was worried if he gets blue or something that we would rush to the emergency department, but I haven't noticed anything like that."
respiratory,"OK, OK good. Has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?","No, I don't think so. We've been trying to be very careful with the pandemic and everything going on."
respiratory,"For sure, any travel to anywhere recently?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and is he an other-wise healthy baby?","Yeah, so, uh, healthy but he was born premature at 36 weeks."
respiratory,OK.,"And no complications really with the pregnancy or after he was born. But yeah, he was premature."
respiratory,"OK, and so he didn't need any hospitalizations right after birth, right?","No, he was fine after birth."

respiratory,"OK, and does anyone at home smoke?",Nope.
respiratory,"OK, well, those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?","Yeah, no, I was just really worried like, the grunting is just really scaring us. So do you, I was just wondering if you know what it could be."
respiratory,"Yeah, so the grunting is worrisome. He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?","Yeah, and will he need to stay in the hospital at all?"
respiratory,"Yeah so for now, because, if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen, and IV hydration, he'll need to stay in the hospital until he's better from that standpoint. I should also mention, we should do a covid swab on him as well because his symptoms are in line with covid as well, so we'll have to do that to rule it out.","OK, yeah, that sounds good, Uh, uh, yeah, thank you so much."
respiratory,What brings you here today?,"Hi I am having difficulties breathing and I've just had this cough and it's, It's been two months now."

respiratory,No? And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air?,"No, it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep.

respiratory,"OK, and how? Is there like? How much do you walk or move around that you get short of breath? Or are you short of breath at rest as well?","Uhm? I'm short of breath all the time. Yeah, it's just, It's it's worse when I am moving."

respiratory,"Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission.",Sure.
respiratory,"OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?","Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen."

respiratory,"Okay, um, alright um, just wanted to see if it was uh like formally diagnosed. Sometimes people uh, um, yeah, it's important to have that, uh, those tests done. Um, and do you have any allergies?","Um, no none. None, yeah."
respiratory,"Okay. Um, and uh, are your immunizations up to date?","Yes, I believe so."

respiratory,"Okay, and how is your mobility now?","Um pretty good. My hips still give me some issues once in awhile, but um, for the most part, it's been okay."
respiratory,"Okay, that's good. It sounds like the rehab went well.",Yeah.
respiratory,"And uh, right now, can you tell me um, a little bit about your living situation? Like where you're living and who you're living with?","Um, I live by myself in an apartment on the 1st floor."
respiratory,"Okay, um and, do you smoke cigarettes?","Uh no, I quit two years ago."
respiratory,"Okay, and that's, that's great. Um, prior to that, how long did you smoke for, and how much?","Oh, for like 40-plus years um, I used to smoke a pack a day."
respiratory,"Okay, well that's great that uh, that you quit, so congratulations.",Thank you.
respiratory,And do you drink alcohol?,"I drink once in a while. Like maybe every other day, I'll have a glass of wine."
respiratory,"Okay, and um, uh anybody, or sorry, have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?",Uh no.
respiratory,You said you went to the stores and stuff like that.,"Yeah, maybe from there, yeah."
respiratory,"Okay, and have you traveled anywhere else, outside of the city?","Um, not recently, no."
respiratory,"Alright, um, and any exposures to any like dust, chemicals, things like that?","Um, I live in an old building so maybe. Um, but it hasn't bugged me before."
respiratory,"Okay, uh, and are you working currently or, or retired?",I'm retired.
respiratory,"Okay, well, what did you do before?","I used to work uh, on the assembly line for Chrysler."
respiratory,"Okay, were there any exposures uh, there that you were aware of, like things that you were breathing in?","Uh not that I was aware of, but they were always like smoke and fumes and things like that because it was like a factory, so maybe."
respiratory,"Right, okay, that makes sense. Um, and in the family, are there, anybody who, who's had problems with their hearts or lungs?","Um, my mom had lung cancer when she was 50. And, like, all the, like diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol runs on my, ran on my father's side of the family."
respiratory,"I see, did anybody have uh, heart attacks or, or stroke?","Uh, yeah, so my father had a heart attack when he was 49. Uh, stroke I'm not too sure about."
respiratory,"Okay, thank you. And, um, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Um, was there anything else that you wanted to add that I maybe forgot?","Um, no, that's about it, but I, how can I treat myself now? How do I make this cough go away?"
respiratory,"For sure, so, um, we will first get your vitals here and we'll see if your oxygen levels um, are low, then it would be important to put on some oxygen first, um, just to make sure that that's stable. Um, and from there we will um, get a chest x-ray um, and uh, run some lab work to, to try to help figure out the, the diagnosis better, but in the meantime, we'll use um, some inhalers because it's possible that this is a COPD exacerbation similar to uh last year, um, and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate, so make breathing easier, and then um, also if it is a COPD exacerbation, it will likely require antibiotics, as well as some steroids for the, the inflammation for five days. Uh, but since your symptoms currently overlap with uh, COVID as well, you'll have to get a, a COVID nasal swab.","Okay, okay for sure."
respiratory,"Okay, so uh, we'll get that started.",Okay. Thank you so much.

Um but since you're having, uh you're symptomatic right now, we will definitely get like a Covid swab test done for you.",OK.
respiratory,"And if you start having any, just monitor for your symptoms. Um you should have the test back within 48 hours. Until then, uh at least for 14 days you should try to isolate in your own room, wear a mask around uh your partner, uh and not go outside, so just self isolate.",OK.

respiratory,"Okay um, alright. Uh um okay, sorry, one moment. Okay um, so is there anything that makes your cough better? What do you do to make it go away?","Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own."
respiratory,And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?,"Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't."
respiratory,"I see. So this started a couple of months ago, has this ever happened to you before that?","No, before that I've been fine."

respiratory,Are you still using the eczema cream?,"No, no. That kind of just went away on its own, or like right after I used the cream. Like it's good now."
respiratory,"Okay, good. Are you allergic to anything?","No, I don't think so. Maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes, in the springtime."
respiratory,What happens then?,"Um, just sometimes like uh, I don't know if it's like a pollen allergy like I, I do get some, I guess I do get like some nasal congestion and things like that."
respiratory,"Um, have you ever seen an allergist?","No, I haven't."

respiratory,"Okay, okay. Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?","No, no."
respiratory,"Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?","Um definitely in, in gym class, but other than that it hasn't really affected me."
respiratory,Does it wake you up at night?,"No, so far no. I, I like, I get pretty good sleep."
respiratory,"Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur? How many times a week, or how many times a month?","Uh, so they just started like two months ago, and I've had like maybe four or five of them in total."
respiratory,"Okay, okay. Uh, and they kind of get better on their own. Okay, so we can sort of talk about these, sorry, puffers that you might need to, to use as needed. Um, your sister might have some of those, so you might be familiar with what I'm talking about.",Yeah.
respiratory,"Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?","Uh no, I don't have any questions at all. Thank you so much."
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, I've had uh, a cough that's been um, bugging me for the last several months now, and more recently I've noticed that I've started to bring up a bit more, or a little bit of blood as well."
respiratory,"Okay, well that's not good. So you said the cough started several months ago, how many months ago do you think, like three, four, five?","Uh, yeah I would say, yeah, maybe like, like five or six, and it kind of started um, it was really infrequent and so it didn't really, well I thought it was just the usual smoking, but it's been getting worse over these last, over these past six months."
respiratory,"Okay and um, the blood in the cough, when did that start?","So that started about, uh, about two weeks ago."
respiratory,"Two weeks ago, okay. Um, how much blood are you coughing up like, if uh, like is it the size of your palm, is it more than that, less than that?","Uh, I would say less than that, like each time there's maybe to about the size of I don't know, uh, like a looney. So like inside of the palm."
respiratory,"Okay, sure. Um, and are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with your cough?","Yeah, now that you mention it, I have been. It's uh, you know, I thought that was just kind of me getting older and the smoking, but I've certainly been able, I haven't been able to walk as far and even uh, to the end of the driveway getting the mail now is, is pretty, I'll get short of breath. Before I used to be able to walk a lot further than that, just a couple of years ago."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. Um, and sorry you said, you mentioned, you mentioned you had some wheezing as well, right?","Um, I haven't really had any, noticed any wheezing."
respiratory,"No, okay. Um, and have you had a fever recently?",No.
respiratory,Weight loss?,"Um yeah, now that you mention it, maybe, maybe a little bit, like 5 to 10 pounds over the last, the last month."

respiratory,"Okay, any rashes?",No.

respiratory,"Okay, and how about chest pain?","No, I haven't had any chest pain."
respiratory,"Okay. Um, and do you ever feel like your heart's racing?","No, I haven't had anything like that."
respiratory,"Okay, how about calf pain when you walk, like more than a block or two?","No, I haven't had any symptoms like that."
respiratory,"Okay, any changes to your bowel movements?",No things have been normal there.
respiratory,"Okay, any nausea or vomiting?",No.
respiratory,"Uh, changes to your urine?",No.
respiratory,"No. Uh, headaches?","Every once in a while, I'll get a headache, but it's, they're pretty mild. Usually I'll take an Advil and they go away."
respiratory,"Sure, um, how about dizziness or fainting spells?","No, I haven't had anything like that."
respiratory,"Okay, um, any confusion or memory loss?","Uh, I guess I um, forget things a little more easily now, but, that's just part of getting older."
respiratory,"Okay, sure. Um, and then other questions I have for you, are um, are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any major medical, medical conditions?","Uh, I have arthritis um, in my knees and uh, hands, um so I have a lot of pain from that sometimes, and I also have high blood pressure and um, GERD."
respiratory,Okay.,"Or acid reflux, yeah."
respiratory,Sure. Do you take any medications for these things?,"Um, yeah, I'll take Tylenol um, for the arthritis, and sometimes use some like, topical creams for my knees. Um and uh I, I take amlodipine as well, I think, for the blood pressure."
respiratory,"Okay. Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?","Yeah, yeah, I remember getting one not too long ago, actually. Well, seven years ago I guess now, but I didn't realize, that we uh, had to get anymore."
respiratory,"Um, so yeah, after you turn 65, they should've given you the Shingrix for shingles and pneumococcal vaccine, does that sound familiar?","Yeah it does. Yeah, I just didn't know about them until that time."
respiratory,"Okay yeah, sure. Any allergies that you have?","Uh, I don't think so."
respiratory,No. How about family history of lung or heart conditions?,"My uh, grandfather had, had lung cancer. And he was in his uh, 70s when he, when he passed away, I remember."
respiratory,"Okay, okay. And do you currently smoke?","I do, yes. Yeah, I, I smoke um, I don't know, maybe half a pack a day now, which is, it's a lot less than I used to. I was smoking two packs a day at one point."
respiratory,"Okay, well congratulations on cutting down. Um, yeah, if you need help cutting that down even more, let us know, we have resources that you may be able to use.","Yeah, absolutely. Thank you."
respiratory,"Yeah, no problem. Do you do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that?","Yeah since I, oh CBD drops, I, at night I find that helps with uh, sleep and, and the pain in my knees."
respiratory,"Oh okay, are those prescribed drops?","Um. well I do buy, I get them from uh, like the uh, the OCS store, I think they're called."
respiratory,"Okay yeah. Okay, that's good that you're getting them from, like an official store.","Yeah they're for, they were, uh, my friend said that they worked for her, and so I just gave them a try and I, I found that they've helped."
respiratory,"Okay, good. Um, and where do you live right now? And who do you live with?","Yeah, so I live in uh, in an apartment with my, with my husband."
respiratory,"Okay, And any like, old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos in this apartment?","No, I don't believe so. It's relatively new. We just moved out of our house, uh, just to make it a little easier on us."
respiratory,"Okay yeah, for sure. Um, have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?","No, I don't think so. I've been spending a lot of time at at home uh, with my husband, and he's been okay."
respiratory,"Okay, good. How about travel?","No, we've been pretty scared with uh, COVID and all that, so we've been staying, staying home for the most part."
respiratory,"Okay, okay, good. Um, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","No, I was just really concerned when I started to see um, the blood coming up more recently, and so I was just hoping to get this figured out."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?",That sounds like a good plan. Thank you.

So, I mean, could that have something to do with it? I'm not sure."

respiratory,"Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?","I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so."

It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics?","No, I haven't."

respiratory,"Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics.

respiratory,"Yeah, certainly so umm, it, it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that I brought on this cough and worsen the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection, it could be a COPD exacerbation and also one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well and so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest Xx-ray and some other investigations as well and uhm, we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your your shortness of breath.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."

Do you have a sore throat?","Maybe a little bit this morning, yeah, like at first it just felt dry like I was thinking like, oh it's like you know I need to take a sip of water or something and now it just feels, now it's starting to think, I feel a little bit sore, I think."

respiratory,"No, OK. How about any changes to your hearing or vision?",No.
respiratory,"No, how about changes in smell or taste?","Uh, no, that's like a Covid thing, right? Like I was hoping because I could still, I could still like taste my coffee this morning, I was hoping that that means I don't have Covid, but yeah, I don't really know."
respiratory,"I mean yeah, some people have it, some people don't. Um I guess people with Covid present in different ways, yeah yeah, do you have a fever at all?","Um like when I came in here, when the nurse took my temperature, she said I had um, like she said I had a fever.

But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?","Yeah, that that sounds great. That's really what it, like, I I don't feel super sick, I just really wanna know if I have Covid or not."

Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER.

respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I just came in today, I actually had asthma as a kid and I used to be on the puffers and it pretty much resolved by the time I was around like 18 years old, and I've been pretty good since then. I haven't even been really using the puffers for the last five years, but just recently, just during the winter I started noticing some of my symptoms coming back and now, especially over the last few months whenever I'm doing something like going to the gym or exercising, I do get that shortness of breath and I feel my throat closing in again and recently for the last, I would say a week I've also been having some wheezing as well. So yeah, I just wanted to come back and make sure everything is alright."
respiratory,"OK sure, so just to rewind a little bit. When were you first diagnosed with asthma?","So I was diagnosed when I was, I think it was like when I was 13 years old."
respiratory,"OK, OK. So can you tell me a little bit about the symptoms that you're experiencing right now? OK, so you said some shortness of breath, when did that start?","So yeah, in the last, I would say two months I've noticed it, similarly to when I was younger, especially when I'm on the treadmill or running, I get short of breath very easily. But at rest I'm fine, I don't have any trouble, but I've noticed it for the last few months."
respiratory,"OK, so it's mostly when you're exercising or with activities?",Mhm.
respiratory,OK. And do you feel wheezy as well?,"Yeah, in the last one to two weeks I would say I'm also wheezing as well. Mainly during like, if I'm running or still, with exercise, I feel myself wheezing. Yeah, so that's been an issue for the last couple of weeks."
respiratory,"So once you stop activity, does your shortness of breath and wheezing eventually resolve?","Yeah, yeah, so I just have to kind of sit down and relax for a bit and then it goes away on its own."
respiratory,"OK, how long does it last before it goes away?","Probably, at least, like I would say 10 to 15 minutes."
respiratory,"OK, OK.",Until I'm fully kind of recovered.
respiratory,"Ok, Ok. Are You coughing as well?","Uhm, yeah, when I'm exercising, that's when all of that happens. The wheezing, the coughing, but throughout the day otherwise, I'm not coughing."

So yeah, but none to any medications that I know of."
respiratory,"OK, so you're not getting any night time symptoms, and you're only getting day time symptoms with activity, right?",Yeah.
respiratory,Has this prevented you from going to work or school?,"Oh yeah, so I, just this past week, I usually do my running, like morning workout right before work, and just one of the days after I worked out, I felt just terrible, with this coughing and short of breath so I just decided to take a day off work that day. But then I realized it kind of goes away on its own, so for the other days I have been going to work."
respiratory,"OK, OK, good. And, alright, and then any medications that you're on?","I'm on a, Just one of those steroid creams for my eczema."
respiratory,"OK, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?",Yep.
respiratory,"OK, uhm, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?","No heart conditions, but yeah asthma is pretty big in my family, as well as eczema, like my mom has it, my sister has it, so yeah asthma is pretty big."
respiratory,"OK, how about cancers?","Uhm, no, I don't think anyone in the family has any cancers."

respiratory,"OK, OK, any old carpets, pets, mold or asbestos in the house?","No, nothing like that."
respiratory,"OK, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?","Yeah, I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now, I just don't know if my asthma has just uh, come back."
respiratory,"Yeah so, what we're gonna do is, we're going to do a PFT, so pulmonary function test on you, cause it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning, so we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X-ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as, we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again and we'll also give you a long acting.",OK.
respiratory,"As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds good.

Those were uh, yeah, that was last week for about three days, and then I started to feel better. But I still have this cough, that, it's still going on."

Often times when we get sick, or we have an infection or inflammation of the, uhm, the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you're, you have those symptoms come back again, or you develop a fever, we can, you can definitely, we can do something more about that.

respiratory,"Yeah, so what we should do for her right now is, she's seven years old, um what I'm thinking right now with her symptoms especially coming on after uh exertion, being worse in the winter, she may have asthma.",OK.
respiratory,"And although she doesn't have any family history of it, it can happen without family history as well. Um so we would like to uh try and do uh what's called a pulmonary function test. That will help us kind of understand uh if she has um asthma or not and then we can try her on um, it's called a short acting beta agonist, so it's a puffer.",OK.
respiratory,"And uh usually when she gets these types of symptoms, she can use the puffer to help her. Uh and if it um helps her then it's most likely that she does have asthma and she will need um that puffer and then she might also need another puffer, which is an inhaled corticosteroid, um for the future to decrease um the likelihood that this asthma gets worse in the future.","OK, OK yeah thank you."
respiratory,"Yeah, no worries. So yeah, so yeah we'll get those tests done and then go from there.","OK, sounds great."

And then I started getting a fever four days ago and it has been going on for the last couple of days as well. And the highest temperature I measured on myself was 38.8 degrees Celsius and yeah, so that, that's, that's my main concern right now."
respiratory,"OK and, since the sore throat started 5 days ago has it been getting better, worse or staying the same?","I would say it's getting worse. I have some pain with swallowing food as well as, like now, even when I'm talking a little, I'm getting some pain as well."
respiratory,"OK, have you been able to maintain your appetite?",I do feel like I've lost a bit of my appetite over the last three to four days.

respiratory,"OK, so have you been around anybody who's been sick?","I just had to go into work like one day last week just to grab some of my stuff, but didn't really come into contact with anyone. My fiance does go to his work like a couple, like three or four times during the week, so I don't know if he got into contact with anyone, It's, it's hard to say."

But did you have anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about, or any other symptoms maybe?","No, I don't think so. Do you think it can be covid at all?"
respiratory,"Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case.","OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
respiratory,So what brings you in?,"Yeah, so um I just came in because uh so I I have this cough that's been going on for the last five years, but over the last month it's really been getting worse. Um and like last week I I've just been constantly coughing. So yeah, I was just a bit concerned."
respiratory,"Yeah, OK, so you said the past couple of years you've been coughing. So how many years exactly would that be? Two, three, four?","Probably five I would say, and I was diagnosed with uh COPD around that time."
respiratory,"OK, OK, um the cough that you currently have, um is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlegm?",Uh I'm pretty much always bringing up like this uh white material.
respiratory,"White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes?","It's pretty much there all the time, but uh it's definitely getting worse. Um it is, I think, the worst in the morning um when I wake up and I just feel like there's just a bunch of gunk stuck in the back of my throat."
respiratory,"OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?",I would say it's harsh.
respiratory,"Harsh, OK. And has the quality of your cough changed at all in the past few years? Like does it sound different than it used to?","Um I don't know if it sounds different, but uh especially for the last month I would say I'm bringing up more of the material, and it's usually white over the five years, but um I noticed uh in the last week-ish, it's had a yellowish tinge to it as well."
respiratory,"OK, OK, so it's changed a little bit. Um and are you experiencing any shortness of breath with this?","No I I don't think so, like I sometimes when I'm walking around uh doing more stuff, uh working in the garden like I feel like I might have to breathe a little bit harder, but uh not regularly."
respiratory,"OK, OK, that's good. Um and any wheezing?","Uh, yeah. It's like usually I start coughing a lot more when I'm starting to do any kind of activities and sometimes when I start coughing more, I also start wheezing. Um but uh right now, I'm fine."

respiratory,How about a stuffy nose? Runny nose?,"Uh no, not really."
respiratory,"No, OK. How about changes to your smell or taste?",Uh nope.
respiratory,"No, OK. Uh chest pain?","Not chest pain, but when I get into those coughing fits, sometimes it feels just really tight in my chest."
respiratory,"Oh, yeah.",But it tends to go away with uh just some rest.
respiratory,"Oh OK, OK. Um how about palpitations? Like feeling like your heart is racing?","Uh no, I don't think so."
respiratory,"No, OK. How about some swelling in your limbs?","I I did notice, like uh a little bit of swelling in my uh both my, like right by my ankles. My shoes, like like even when I wear my socks, it like leaves little marks and then uh I just feel my like my shoes are tighter."

respiratory,"OK, it's when um your heart's not pumping as much as it should be, um so you get some backup of fluid. I ask because you you mentioned that you um were having some swelling in your legs.","Oh I yeah, I I yeah, I didn't know anything about that. I just thought that was uh, it's been going on for a while now and didn't really bother me too much."
respiratory,"OK. Um alright, and are you taking any medications?","Yeah, I have this medication uh right now I'm taking it, it's called lisinopril."
respiratory,"OK, so that's for your blood pressure?",Yeah.
respiratory,"OK. Are you on any puffers? Sorry, go ahead.","Yes I'm on, no worries, I'm on um uh two puffers right now. One of them is like just one that I use when I really need it. And then um there's another one, so I think that's like the Ventolin puffer."
respiratory,Yeah.,"And then the other one is called, I think it's called Spiriva."
respiratory,"OK, OK perfect. And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits?","Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help."
respiratory,"OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though?","Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much.

respiratory,"OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?","Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be."
respiratory,"Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?","OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
respiratory,"Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test.","OK, sounds good."

respiratory,Dry OK. So no blood in the with the coughing?,No blood.
respiratory,And does he sound wheezy to you?,"He does, yeah, he's still sounding a little bit wheezy now. It's it's better than last night. He was a bit more wheezy last night."

Does is he otherwise healthy or does he have any longstanding medical conditions?","He's been healthy. Yeah, I know he did have like he would get some itchy skin when he was a bit when he was like a baby, but he hasn't needed any creams for that for a long time."

respiratory,"OK, OK, any pets at home?",He's got a fish.
respiratory,"A fish, OK. And has he has come into contact with anyone sick recently?","No, I don't think so. I mean when at school, they've been pretty diligent with I mean covid and everything right now, so I think he's been OK."
respiratory,"Ok, uhm has he traveled anywhere recently?",No.
respiratory,"No, OK. OK, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","Yeah, I was just wondering if if my son had asthma as well and if like you need a prescription for inhalers."
respiratory,"Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?","That sounds good, thank you."

However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot. And so I ask you to continue doing so, and we will get back to you when the results are in.","OK, yeah, that sounds good, thank you so much."
respiratory,What brings you in?,"So I've had a fever that I measured this morning and I had a cough.  I've had a cough these last several days. Yeah, today is Friday so it started Monday, so I guess like yeah the cough started four days ago."
respiratory,"OK, and the fever started four days ago as well?","Well, I've been feeling hot this week, but I checked my temperature this morning and it was the first time I checked it and it was 38.5."
respiratory,"OK, so that's definitely a fever, so we can take your temperature today as well. Umm, so have your symptoms been the same or getting worse, or be getting better over the past few days?","They are getting worse. I've been starting to feel really fatigued and, uh, tired as well and the cough has gotten worse too."

respiratory,"OK, good. An yeah, that's really good. Um, do you know if you have any family history of any lung conditions or heart conditions?","No, I don't think so."
respiratory,"OK, how about cancers in the family?","I think my grandfather had bladder cancer, but, uh, I'm not sure."
respiratory,"OK, and I forget if I asked you earlier, but have you had any changes to your urinary habits, any changes in your urine itself or voiding frequency?","No, I haven't had any changes there and I haven't noticed any like blood or color changes. No pain."

respiratory,"OK, and um, any concerns for you know old carpets or mold or asbestos in the duplex that you're living in?","Not in our unit so I mean, maybe upstairs, but if it's anything like our place, then no."
respiratory,OK. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we end the interview?,"Uh, no, well  I guess I was just concerned about about COVID."
respiratory,"Yeah, you know that's the top on my list of differential diagnosis for you. So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those. And then if you're still sick or your symptoms change, we can reassess to make sure it's not a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, in which case we can prescribe antibiotics.","OK yeah, thank you for all that information. Sounds great."
respiratory,"OK, well take care then, alright.",Thank you.
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I just came in because I've been having this cough that's getting worse over the last uh one and a half week and uh, I've also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath. Um and I also noticed uh my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week."
respiratory,"OK, so yeah, let's break this down. The cough, when did that start?","The cough, I think it started uh probably like around 10 days ago."
respiratory,"10 days ago, OK, and how about the shortness of breath?",That just started in the last uh I think 3 days.
respiratory,"OK, and then the the bowel bowel changes, when did that start?","Yes, I think it also started in like, I would say, for the last three days I've been getting uh diarrhea."
respiratory,"OK OK, so let's go back to the cough, is it constant or um is it triggered by certain things like the cold air, dust, um you know, um, certain times of the day, like morning, evening?","Um, I would say it's pretty pretty constant since the last like 10 days, uh it's, there's no real pattern to it, and I've mostly just been inside my house. I don't think there are any triggers or I don't own any pets or anything like that, no new rugs, like uh, no no new changes really in my house."
respiratory,"OK, OK and um have you tried anything to make it better?","Um, no, not really. I I've done some uh home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps, but it didn't really do anything."
respiratory,"OK. Um and how about um the quality of that cough? Is it, does it sound harsh?","Um, yeah I would say it's getting a little bit harsh. It's more just like, I'm not bringing anything up, it's more like a dry cough um, but yeah, I would say it's getting worse, definitely."
respiratory,"OK. Um, is it a dry cough then, or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that?","No, no, I haven't seen any blood at all and rarely do I bring like up some sputum, but like most of the time it's just a dry cough."
respiratory,"OK, it's a dry cough. Um and would you say the cough's getting worse?","Yeah, I'd definitely say in the last um three to four days I've been just coughing nonstop, it's very irritating."
respiratory,"Yeah, have you experienced anything like this before?","Um, probably a few years ago, I think I caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just a lot of coughing. But since then, nothing else."
respiratory,"OK. Um the shortness of breath, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?","Uh probably like a five. It kind of just started out with uh, three days ago, was kind of like I just"
respiratory,"Yeah, um does anything make the shortness of breath worse? Like I guess um you know exertion, uh laying down, anything like that?","Um, not really. Maybe like sitting down helps sometimes, but even when I'm sitting down I'm still coughing."
respiratory,OK. OK and um do you have any wheeziness?,"No, I don't think so."
respiratory,"OK, any chest pain?","Um, maybe from all the coughing, sometimes I feel like there's some pain there, but it's not not anything that's too painful."

respiratory,OK. How about nausea or vomiting?,"No, nothing like that."
respiratory,OK um constipation?,"No, diarrhea."
respiratory,"Diarrhea, right. Um how often are you having a bowel movement right now?","I would say uh like I've been going, probably more than eight times a day, probably in the last few days like 10 times a day."
respiratory,"Oh wow, OK, and each time are you producing a lot of stool, or is it just a little bit each time?","Like a little bit, but it's mostly liquidy."
respiratory,OK. Any solids at all? Like is it semi solid at all?,"Um maybe a little bit, but mostly it's just liquid."

respiratory,"OK, do you take any medications for those conditions?","Yeah, so for diabetes I'm taking this medication called uh like I think metformin and then for the blood pressure, uh I think it's, I forgot the name, I think it's something like um ramipril or something like that."
respiratory,"Yep, OK, and you're taking that um as directed, right?","Yeah, I've been taking that regularly and my blood pressure, I've been measuring, it's been pretty steady, no changes."
respiratory,"OK, that's good. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?","I did have my appendix removed, probably in my 20s, but uh that was the only thing."
respiratory,"OK, um and do you have any allergies?","No, not not really."
respiratory,OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?,Yep.
respiratory,OK. Are you on any other medications besides the ramipril and metformin?,Just uh like multi vitamins for men over 50.
respiratory,"OK, OK. Um any family history of heart conditions or lung conditions that you know of?","Um yeah, so my family, like diabetes is pretty big, it runs in the family and uh my father in his 60s uh like died from a heart attack. Um other than that, not anything else I can think of, no."
respiratory,"OK, any cancers in their family?","Uh no, I don't think so."
respiratory,"OK, do you smoke?","I used to, I I quit probably five years ago, but before that I used to smoke probably a pack a day for more than 20 years."
respiratory,"Oh OK, well good job for cutting down and quitting, um.",Yeah.

respiratory,"OK, well that's good and that's smart, um just because you don't know what you have, right?",Mhmm.
respiratory,"Yeah OK, do, can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or two weeks or even three weeks?","Um I go to the grocery store, then I go to work, I haven't noticed anyone being sick at work, but you know, you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it, with this"
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. Um yeah, for sure, have you traveled to anywhere recently?","No, uh we've been in Canada, Ontario, haven't left to go anywhere."
respiratory,"OK. OK, well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or did you have any concerns, anything that you wanted to discuss today?","Yeah no, I just uh was wondering if I can get the covid test, that would just, I wanted to make sure I don't give anyone covid if I do have it."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure, I think that's a good idea. Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?","My, if my breathing gets worse uh I'll just go to the emergency Department?"
respiratory,"Yes, please do.","OK, sounds good."
respiratory,"Alright, take care.","You too, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, nice to meet you I, I've been having just over the last week my cough that's been getting worse and I had a fever a couple of nights and just yesterday I noticed that I started having a loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried."
respiratory,"OK, so yeah, let's rewind a little bit. The cough you said started a couple of weeks ago, so would that be about 2 weeks? Three weeks?","I would say last week, so like 7 seven days ago."
respiratory,"Seven days ago, OK. So that started seven days ago and then when did the fever start?","The fever I hasn't been constant, but I've like had some nights where I just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes even getting these chills I've been recorded at a temperature, but I think I've had a fever at least three times in the last week."
respiratory,"OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?",Yeah.
respiratory,"OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?","I think the taste happened like before, but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning like at breakfast, I couldn't really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner, but smell, I kind of lost around the evening."
respiratory,OK.,"Yeah, all just started yesterday."
respiratory,"OK. Um alright, so let's go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started?","Yeah, it's been pretty constant. It's been getting worse, especially like in the last few days. I'm mainly coughing like before I was coughing mainly at night, but now I'm coughing throughout the day."
respiratory,"OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night? Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?","Uh no, not really. Like I've lived in the same place for awhile, no new changes and I've been barely going outside, so I don't think there are any triggers."
respiratory,"OK, and in terms of the quality of your cough is that, would you say it's harsh? Barky?","Uhm, I would just say it's like kind of harsh at times, but mainly it's a dry cough, like I'm not bringing anything up."
respiratory,"OK, OK. And then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right?",No.
respiratory,OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?,"Not the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new."
respiratory,"OK. And then, um, have you experienced any shortness of breath?","Um, not really, no."

respiratory,"OK. Uh, experienced any weight loss recently?","No, not that I know."
respiratory,"OK, how about fatigue?","I have been a bit tired in the last few days. The fevers at night and morning. Just feeling a little bit crummy, just not really energetic, energetic to do anything."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure.","Just been planner, just sitting on the couch."
respiratory,"OK. Any changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes?","No, I haven't noticed anything like that."
respiratory,"OK, you mentioned loss of smell. Do you have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?","I did have a runny nose earlier this week, but that's kind of subsided. Other than that, I don't really feel too much congestion. I've been taking Tylenol, the Tylenol cold so I don't know if that helped."
respiratory,"OK, how often are you taking the Tylenol cold?",I just took it like for four days just before going to sleep in the last week.

respiratory,"Yeah yeah, that makes sense. Any nausea or vomiting?",No.
respiratory,"No, OK. And any changes in terms of urine?","No, I've been peeing alright."
respiratory,"OK, good. Any major or a longstanding medical conditions, or are you otherwise healthy?","No, I've been fortunate otherwise healthy. I had asthma as a kid, but like I haven't had to use the puffers for more than a decade."
respiratory,Oh ok. OK. And what triggers your asthma?,I think back then it was just when I did sports and I was running around a lot. I've been fine for the last 10 years at least.
respiratory,"OK. OK, that's good. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?",No.
respiratory,"No, OK. Any are you on any medications?","Currently just the other thing, Tylenol cold, but other than that no other medications."
respiratory,"OK, not even other over the counter medications or herbal supplements?","No, nothing like that."

respiratory,"OK, have you ever thought about cutting down?","Yeah, especially with this pandemic going on, it's been, I've been trying to cut down just because like I don't want to get the, get COVID and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking. So I've been trying to cut down."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure it's good that you're trying to cut down. We have resources to help you if you ever need them.","Yeah, for sure."
respiratory,Do you do marijuana?,"No, no, I've never tried marijuana."
respiratory,"OK, how about other recreational drugs?","No, um, besides alcohol, nothing else."
respiratory,"OK, and then um, I guess I'll ask you about the alcohol, uhm, how much do you drink?","Um, um, not that much. I'd probably say like a few times a week when there's a game on. I just grab a couple of beers, but that's about it."
respiratory,"OK. Uhm, and where do you live right now?","Yes, I just live just outside of London with my wife and daughter in a small townhouse."
respiratory,OK and anyone else at home sick?,"No. I I've kind of stayed away once I noticed some symptoms. I'm just kind of just staying in my room, not getting out. I don't wanna make any of my families like."

respiratory,"OK. Uhm, OK, that's good. Those were all the questions I had for you today. Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?","Uh, yeah, I I that I'm just wondering like I could it be COVID I I don't know. I don't know if someone in the office had it or yeah, it was just basically worried about, if I had COVID."
respiratory,"Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds good. I'll, I'll let my work know and yeah, hopefully it comes back negative, but I'll stay away from everyone till then."
respiratory,"OK, sounds great, thank you.","Alright, thank you so much."
respiratory,How are you?,"I'm not so good, these last few days I haven't benn able to reallykeep anything down and not feeling so good."
respiratory,"OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, when you say last few days, did you mean the past two days? 3 days?","Well, I feel like maybe the last five days I just haven't been feeling so good and I haven't really felt like eating. But these last two days I've been really nauseous and I've thrown up a few times."
respiratory,"OK, when you say you haven't been feeling good for the past five days, is it that you feel achy? Do you feel hot like you have a fever, or do you feel weak?","Yeah, I do feel hot and um, yeah, maybe a bit tired."

respiratory,"OK, and what color is it?","Uhh, yeah, usually usually kind of like yellowish clear."

respiratory,"Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said? So have you had headaches like this in the past?","Yeah, I had similar headaches before I think. They come like this. Like if I didn't get a good sleep or from not drinking enough water or something, I'll kind of get a headache like this. Kind of feels like it's squeezing."

respiratory,"OK, OK, good. It's good that you're on both of those. Do you take any other medications like over the counter medications or herbal supplements?","Yeah, I've been taking vitamin D and also a multivitamin. I heard that that we don't get enough vitamin D throughout the winter."
respiratory,"Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?","No, my weight's been, uh, about the same unfortunately and I haven't had any night sweats.

respiratory,"OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems? Colon problems?","Yeah, my dad actually had colon cancer. He was 70 and so that's why we went and decided to get a colonoscopy instead of just doing the immunohistochemistry test."
respiratory,"OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?","No, just my dad had colon cancer."
respiratory,OK. And do you smoke at all?,"No, I don't."
respiratory,"OK, how about marijuana?","Um, no, I don't smoke marijuana."

respiratory,"On the 8th floor, OK, any issues in terms of like old carpet or mold or asbestos in the apartment?","It's a newish building so there isn't really any carpet actually in the unit, so yeah, it's pretty clean that way."
respiratory,OK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?,"Well, I'm just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better."
respiratory,"Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?","Yeah, that sounds like a great start. Thank you."
respiratory,What brought you in today?,"Yeah, so uh, just randomly like 2 days ago I just started having this chest pain when I'm breathing and it's just been getting worse and then because of that, I'm finding that I'm very short of breath as well, so I just got really concerned."
respiratory,"OK, I see. When did the chest pain start?","So, there was some discomfort like just 2 days ago, but then just yesterday it started getting very painful when I was breathing. So yeah, I would say 1 day ago."
respiratory,"OK, and were you doing anything at the time when the chest pain started? Like did you get in a car accident maybe? Or any trauma to the chest or anything you can think of?","No, not really. I was just at home and then I noticed that when, I like, take a deep breath in, it's just, like, a very sharp pain. It's kind of like in my right side of the chest and it feels like a stabbing pain."
respiratory,"OK, and so the pain comes on when you breathe in, or yeah, when you take a deep breath. Does the pain come on at any other points or does it go away?","Uh, it's mostly, yeah, I feel the sharp pain when I breathe in."
respiratory,"OK, so the pain is intermittent then, it sounds like. And has there been anything you've tried that's made the pain better?","Not really, just more shallow breathing, and it hurts less with that, but that's about it."
respiratory,"OK, and are there any positions that help make the pain any better like leaning forward or laying down?","Not really, it's uh, it's pretty much the same, I think."
respiratory,"OK, and uh, you mentioned you had shortness of breath as well. When does this come on?","Since yesterday it's been pretty constant and it's more like, Uh, just uh, I'm really having trouble getting any deep breaths in, so I feel like I'm having to just breathe faster and more shallow."
respiratory,"I see, OK, and has anything like this happened to you before?","No, never."
respiratory,"OK, and have you been experiencing any headaches?",No.
respiratory,"How about any viral symptoms, like eye redness, nasal discharge, or nasal congestion or cough?","I have been having a little bit of a cough, but that's it, like, it kind of started today, but it's nothing too significant."

respiratory,"OK, and uh, any cancers that run in the family?",Not that I know of.
respiratory,"OK, so it sounds like you had this uncomfortable feeling in your chest about two days ago, but the pain really came on yesterday and it's really painful when you have a deep deep breath. So, in conjunction with your symptoms of not being able to take a deep breath and being short of breath, it sounds like you possibly have what's called a pneumothorax and so we'll do a physical exam and do a chest X-ray as well to examine this and check vitals as well to make sure that you're work of breathing is OK and we can do some blood work and go from there.","OK, yeah, sounds good. Should be like, worried at all?"
respiratory,"I think right now, you're speaking in full sentences and you're not short of breath at rest, typically, when this this happens, if it's small enough, it'll usually resolve on its own and so we'll get some more information from the imaging and the lab results, but it's reassuring that you haven't been getting worse since it happened.","OK, alright, sounds good. Thank you so much."

respiratory,"Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?",That sounds really good. Thank you.

We'll also order some imaging studies, with a CTPA it's called. Uh but before we go ahead with that, was there anything else that that you wanted to add?","No, I think that's that's all."
respiratory,"OK, so we'll get the lab work started, as well as the imaging ordered. It will look for, to see if there is any pulmonary embolism present, because with the surgery last week and being immobilized for a period of time, it is a risk factor for it, and leg swelling with uhm coughing up blood can be symptoms of this.

respiratory,"Right, so, and in terms of the home environment, does anyone smoke in the house?",No.
respiratory,"No OK, alright so I think that's all the questions I had right now. Do you have any questions or concerns?","No, no questions, but uhm, actually, what do you think she has and how can we treat her?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?","Uh no, that sounds great, thank you."
respiratory,"You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there.","OK, sounds great thanks."
respiratory,You're welcome.  Take care.,You too.
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, so I've been feeling just really down recently in the last week.

And on top of all of that, within the last three to four days I've been getting muscle aches all over my body."
respiratory,"OK, alright so the sore throat started 5 days ago and then the fever started when?","So the fever. I think I haven't measured it, but I started having chills like 3 days ago."
respiratory,"Three days ago, OK, and the muscle aches started two days ago?",I would say 3 days ago as well.
respiratory,"Three days ago, OK. OK, are you having any trouble swallowing foods or fluids?","A little bit with solids with a sore throat but liquids, I'm doing OK right now."
respiratory,"OK. And is it hard for you to like, are you having issues vocalising at all?","No, I think my voice has been the same. It's just when I'm not talking, especially if I'm swallowing my own like spit, it still hurts sometimes, but mainly with solid food."

respiratory,"Yeah, OK. How about nausea or vomiting?","No, no, nothing like that."
respiratory,"OK, OK, and any issues with joint pain? You said your muscle aches, but how about joints?","Um, no, I don't think it's specifically my joints.

respiratory,"OK, do you know if you got a vaccine called Shingrix for shingles and Pneumovax for pneumococcal infections?","Yeah, I actually think I got them just this past season. Uh, with all this COVID going on, I just wanted to make sure I got all those vaccines as well. So yeah, I recently just got them."
respiratory,"OK, good. And and how about any allergies?","Uh, no, I don't have any allergies."
respiratory,"OK, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?","Uhm, no lung conditions and uhh heart conditions, both my mom and dad suffered from like high blood pressure. My dad also had a heart attack when in his 60s. Now there is some heart conditions that run in the family."
respiratory,"OK, OK. And then any cancers in the family?","Uhm, m son actually got diagnosed with colorectal cancer just a few years ago."
respiratory,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.",He's doing OK though. Like it was pretty scary at the time.
respiratory,How old was he when he was diagnosed?,"I think he was, yeah in his forties, 46."
respiratory,"OK, well he's yeah, that's young. Have you had a colonoscopy?","Yeah I had it done. Everything came back normal so yeah, I'm not sure where he got it from."
respiratory,OK. Have you had any sick contacts recently?,"No, no sick contacts that I know of. I've been mainly in my house. I do go outside for groceries and some things like that, but other than that I'm retired. I don't really go out too much."

respiratory,"OK, OK. And then any marijuana?","No, no, I've never had any marijuana or any recreational drugs, no, nothing else."
respiratory,"OK, good, well those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","Yeah, uh, with all this COVID and the pandemic going on, I don't know, I like, I've been mainly at my house, but like I said I do go to do my own groceries. Of course I wear a mask, but I don't know if I might have caught COVID,  so that's something I was worried about."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?","Sounds good. I just had another quick question. I did get the shingles and the pneumococcal vaccine back then but I didn't get the flu vaccine, like should I get it? Is it recommended?"
respiratory,"Yes, it's definitely recommended. So we won't give you the vaccine right now because you have symptoms. But once you are healthy again, you should definitely get the get the flu vaccine and you should get it once a year.","OK, I just never took those vaccines, but I'll do that from now on."
respiratory,"Yeah, it's a good idea, and even if you get the flu, your symptoms won't be as severe if you have the vaccine, so it's definitely something to consider.","OK, alright sounds good."
respiratory,So what brings you here today?,"Yeah, so I've had this cough, ongoing now for the last three days and I found I've had a more difficult time breathing as well."
respiratory,"OK, and So what came first? did the cough come first?","Yeah, the cough started first."

respiratory,"A couple weeks ago, OK, and has it gotten worse since then, or has it stayed about the same?","Uh it, it got worse initially, but it's been about the, uh, well, actually yeah, it's been getting worse 'cause now I've I've started to notice blood in the sputum that wasn't there at first."
respiratory,"OK, and when did you first notice that?","So I, I first saw some blood, uhm, two days ago. It was a really small amount so I didn't worry too much, but I I brought up blood yesterday and again this morning. It's been just about enough to cover a tissue, so it's not a lot of blood each time, but it's pretty red."
respiratory,"OK, and before that were you getting any production throughout your coughs for the last few weeks, like were you producing any sputum?","Uh, no."

respiratory,"OK, and do you remember 2 weeks ago prior to that, were there any factors that might have caused this, like for example, did you travel anywhere or see or was in contact with anyone that was sick?","No I haven't uh, traveled anywhere.

respiratory,"OK, and are you feeling the pain when you're coughing or is it when you're exerting yourself, like when do you feel the pain, and how long does it last?","I, yeah, I will feel it when I cough. I also feel it uh, if I'm maybe moving around as well. Like changing positions or things like that. It hurts for a few minutes and then it it will kind of settle down. If if I'm, if I stay stationary and sort of lean forward a little bit it will it will start to feel better."
respiratory,"Sort of feels better? OK, and besides, besides like leaning forward, has anything helped reduce that pain at all?","Yeah, well if I lie flat, uhm it, it's uh, or sorry. No actually, the pain gets worse if I I lie flat or if I'm if I'm taking a deep breath in. But really, the only thing that helps the pain is if I try to lean forward when I'm sitting down."
respiratory,"OK, I see, and do you have any pain when breathing in or out?","I do, yeah it it gets worse if I if I'm taking a deep breath in, and even more so after I after I cough, if I'm trying to catch my breath, I'll feel it then too."

respiratory,"OK, I see. Yeah so, do you have any questions? Those are all the questions I have. Do you have any questions or concerns?","No, I was just, I guess just concerned about the the blood in the, in the cough."
respiratory,"Yeah, so definitely that's something concerning. We want to make sure there was no, so you work at a homeless shelter, where there may be a tuberculosis case, and your symptoms of coughing up blood as well as losing a significant weight recently, and some of the other symptoms that you described as well, point towards uh TB as one of the causes. No lung cancer history right, in your family?",No.
respiratory,"OK, uhm so we definitely want to do testing for TB. Will do us a smear today of your sputum and we will, since you have been in contact with your family, we will have to contact a public health if the tests come back positive, and it seems that, we'll also do some other testing. Sometimes with tuberculosis you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well, so we might have to do an EKG. We might have to further do an ultrasound, an x-ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well, and be on a course of antibiotics. So I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions or concerns at all?","Not right now. Guess will wait until some of the results come back and yeah, get started."
respiratory,"Yeah, so we'll just do the TB test first, alright?","Alright, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Yeah, so uh I'm just bringing my son uh here to the clinic. He's been having um just I think he's been complaining of uh ear ache in his uh I think it's mainly in his left ear for the last, I'd say at least a week. Um he's been kind of just having discomfort um and over the last few days uh he also started crying because of how much pain he is having, and then um we also noticed that he had like was just feeling warm, so we took his temperature and he actually had a fever just yesterday of like 39 degrees Celsius."
respiratory,"OK, uhm, alright. So let's back up just a little bit. The ear pain, when did that start? You said a couple of days ago, so was that two, three, four days?","Uh I think the discomfort like uh, we saw him scratching his ear for the whole last week, but uh the crying actually started just I would say four days ago, um."
respiratory,OK.,So I think the last few days have been really tough for him.
respiratory,"Yeah, so three, four days. OK, have you taken a look into his ear? Like does does it seem red? Is there discharge?","Uh I think we did see some uh, just like it wasn't red or anything, but I think we did uh see some um just kind of clear to almost uh clear to yellowish fluid from his affected ear."
respiratory,"OK, clear to, you said white-ish?",Uh like it was a bit of a yellow tinge to to it as well.
respiratory,"Yellow, OK, OK. And which ear was it, sorry, the right or left?",Left ear.
respiratory,"Left ear, OK. And the right ear looks normal?","Yeah, right ear, he hasn't been complaining uh at all. I haven't even looked at the right ear yet."
respiratory,"OK, is he itching his ears at all?","Uh he was he was itching like pretty much this whole week, but I think right now he's hesitant to even touch his ears."
respiratory,"OK, and does it look like it's angry on the outside or on the inside of his ears?",I can't really see anything on the outside.
respiratory,"OK, OK, and have you noticed that his hearing has changed at all?","Um he still like answers to us and like I don't think his ear, hearing is affected."
respiratory,"OK. Has he had any past issues with his ears, like ear infections or like hearing issues in the past?","Uh no hearing issues, but he did have uh like he used to, probably when he was uh like 2 years old, he did have a couple ear infections."

respiratory,OK. Um and how about his urine?,"Uh his urine has been the same, like no changes."
respiratory,"No changes, OK good. Is he an otherwise healthy kid or does he have any longstanding conditions?","Yeah, he's pretty healthy. There have been no concerns at all that we've had for the doctor. Uh he's been growing well, um meeting all of his milestones. Um yeah, no, nothing that's concerning."
respiratory,"OK, um do you know if his mother's pregnancy with him was normal? Did she have any complications?","Um she didn't have any like complications during the pregnancy. Uh they did have to, um I forgot what it's called, but uh he was like a difficult baby coming out. Um and he was at term though, he wasn't premature, but they had to use just um some tools to get him out."
respiratory,"OK, OK. Um so it was a vaginal delivery, but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum?","Yeah, yeah it was forceps, yeah."
respiratory,"OK, OK. Um and he's, you mentioned he was full term?","Yeah, he was born at uh 40 weeks."
respiratory,"OK, perfect. Did he need to be hospitalized for any reason after that?","No, he wasn't hospitalized. Uh we stayed there maybe one day extra just because um there was some just kind of misshaping of his head."

respiratory,"OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?",No.
respiratory,"No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?","Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now."
respiratory,"Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.",OK.
respiratory,"Yeah, how does that sound?",That sounds good. Thank you so much.
respiratory,What brings you in today?,"Yeah, I brought my son here. I'm a little bit worried about him because like yesterday he had he had this temperature of like 38.5 um so he's been feeling a little bit hot and he's not swallowing his food, like we've been feeding him some mashed up food but he's not swallowing it. He's just kind of throwing throwing it back out there. Um he's drooling now uh and he sounds kind of muffled um and he's been very short of breath."
respiratory,"That doesn't sound good. Um uh yeah, I'm I'm currently looking at him and he doesn't uh look great. While the uh while the doctor's um taking his vitals and examining the baby, I'll just ask you a couple of questions.",Sure
respiratory,So you said that all of this started about a day ago. How was he doing before that?,"He was fine before that, he had like a an infection, like some sort of viral infection recently, like about a week back, he had like a runny nose and a cough, but that went away."
respiratory,"Um OK, so he had these symptoms about a week ago. Did he see any, did you take him to the hospital or to a clinic?","I took him to our family doctor um and they just suggested some supportive treatments um which we've been doing at home like we try to keep him well hydrated, and we've been keeping an eye on his like um diapers and things like that."
respiratory,"OK, has he been um has he been, how many diapers is he um, are you changing a day?","Usually like about 5, 6, but yesterday it was like 2."
respiratory,OK. Um and uh has he been uh irritable or agitated?,Uh he has been very irritable and fussy.
respiratory,Has he been sleeping OK?,I um no you know what last night he didn't sleep well at all. He was crying the whole night.
respiratory,"Um and uh in terms of uh, so how much has he has he had to eat or drink in the past uh day or two?","Uh he's had about like maybe a bottle of his milk, like of that."
respiratory,OK.,Yeah.
respiratory,That's it?,"Yeah, he's not taking. He's not he's not taking anything else like he's been so fussy and so like he's unwilling to try anything."
respiratory,"OK, um and, OK. Do you feel like he's been drowsy uh and um lethargic?","Um yeah, I feel like he's been a little bit lethargic. Like today, he's more lethargic. All of yesterday, he was very fussy and irritable, but today seems like, he's very slow."
respiratory,"OK, and just a couple of questions about um his past medical history. Does he have any uh medical conditions uh that he was diagnosed with?","Uh no, he's been healthy otherwise."
respiratory,How was your pregnancy with him?,"Normal, yeah no complications there."

respiratory,Any allergies?,"Oh, uh no allergies."

Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely. We'll also check his vitals and um we'll do uh, yeah, we'll go from there. Do you have any questions?","Uh no, thank you."

respiratory,"OK, OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?","No, I was just worried this cough isn't, isn't serious, right? You don't think I have Covid?"
respiratory,"So because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we're going to get a swab on you done and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse or really severe like you're having neurological symptoms and just seek help from the ER.",For sure. Thank you.

Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show.

respiratory,"OK, and when did the trouble swallowing start?",That started yesterday as well.
respiratory,"OK, and has it been getting worse at all?",I think so. Now she's barely even drinking fluids.
respiratory,"OK, so it's both solids and fluids. OK, have you noticed any swelling in her neck area or redness or swelling in her throat?","Yeah, I've noticed some of that."
respiratory,"OK, you see a lot of redness in there?","I see, yeah, I see quite a bit of redness in there."
respiratory,And has she been drooling at all?,"Yeah, a little bit today."
respiratory,"OK. Alright, any coughing?",Not hat I noticed.
respiratory,"No coughing. OK, and do you notice that she's increasingly fatigued, or just not herself? Or is she irritable?","Yeah, she's very irritable."
respiratory,"OK, do you notice any kind of paleness or blueness in her skin? Anything like that?",She's not blue. She's looking a little pale though.
respiratory,"OK, and sorry, when did the shortness of breath start? Is it getting worse at all?","Shortness of breath started yesterday as well, moreso today which is why I brought her in."
respiratory,"OK, any other symptoms like nausea or vomiting or diarrhea or constipation?","Um, no nothing like that."
respiratory,"OK, and how's her appetite and sleep?","It's been, it's been not great. She's not eating well, I guess because she's in a lo of pain and she didn't sleep well for the past two nights either."
respiratory,"OK uhm, has she had any recent infections at all, like a cold or anything like that?","She did have a cough 2 weeks ago, yeah."
respiratory,"OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?","I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own."
respiratory,"OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?","I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now. But three weeks ago there was someone who was sick."
respiratory,"OK, any past medical history?","Um, no, she's been pretty healthy otherwis."
respiratory,Any issues during pregnancy or after birth at all?,No.
respiratory,Are her immunizations are up to date?,"Um, yes, she didn't get the H. flu vaccine though."
respiratory,"OK, OK, any hospitalizations or anything like that in the past?","Um, no."
respiratory,"OK, and any family history of any medical conditions?","Um, no."
respiratory,"And currently, who does she live with at home?",I'm she lives with myself as well as her older brother.
respiratory,"OK, alright, so yeah those are all the questions that I have.",Do you think this is like an urgent matter?
respiratory,"Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?","Yeah, do you know how long will she have to be in the hospital?"
respiratory,"So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER.","OK. OK yeah, that sounds good."
respiratory,"So I'll give them a call right now, and, uh, you can head over to the ER. Or if you need a ride, we can arrange to do that for you too.","OK, great, that sounds great."
respiratory,Thank you.,You too.
respiratory,How may I help you?,"So, I just came in here because for the last day I've been just getting shortness of breath. I recently, yesterday actually, was just busy at home, cleaning out my basement. And, like that was yesterday afternoon, I did that for a couple hours and then at night I just started to get the shortness of breath. It's continued until today. I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day."
respiratory,"OK, do you have any chest pain?","No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing."
respiratory,OK.,"So yeah, that's, that's that."
respiratory,"And you mentioned a cough as well. With the cough is it, has it been dry, or have you been bringing up sputum?","Uhm, it was, it was mainly dry yesterday, like, like the cough has kind of gone away, but yesterday night I was coughing a lot and it was mostly dry."
respiratory,"OK, have you brought up any blood?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and have you had any infectious symptoms like, eye tearing or red eyes, maybe a runny nose or sore throat?","Uhm, not a sore throat, but it does feel like it, it's kind of like just constricted in there like, uhm, I don't know if it's relevant, but I, I do have asthma. Uh, like I was diagnosed ten years ago, but it's been pretty stable, like it's, like just right now. I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time."
respiratory,"OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today. Uhm, so uhm, so you mentioned that you have had some throat tightness. Have you had any loss of smell or, or loss of taste?","No, nothing like that."

respiratory,"OK. And any muscle aches or, or joint pains?",No.
respiratory,Have you had any fatigue?,No.
respiratory,"OK, alright you mentioned asthma as part of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?","No, it's just asthma and it was diagnosed, I think when I was like, probably 11 or 12 years old."
respiratory,"OK, and do you use inhalers for that?","Yeah, I have two inhalers, uh, like one, one is like a blue one, one is like an, like an orange one, uh, it's, so I think it's one of them is just like, I take whenever I really need to and the other one I take every day. Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms."
respiratory,"OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one.","The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago."
respiratory,"OK, so you don't need it that that often then?",No.
respiratory,"Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?","Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much."
respiratory,"OK, and, and do you use any other medications?","Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds."
respiratory,"OK, and you use a cream for, for your skin too like, yeah?","Yeah, I use, like it's, it's, I think it's like a mixture of like a steroid cream."
respiratory,"OK, and do you have any allergies to medications?",Not that I know of.
respiratory,"OK, and are your immunizations up to date?",Yeah.
respiratory,"Alright, and right now, who are you living with, and whereabouts are you living?","Yeah, so I'm just living with a couple roommates. I just go to college and I'm living with three other roommates."
respiratory,And have you traveled anywhere?,"Uhm, I decided, like, I, yesterday I went home like, to my parents house and helped my dad, that's where I was cleaning the basement. But besides that, that was, that was uh, that was it?"
respiratory,"OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?","Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized."
respiratory,"OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?","Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time."
respiratory,"OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?",No.
respiratory,"Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?","Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time."
respiratory,"OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?","No, like I can't even stand cigarette smoke."
respiratory,"OK, that's good. And do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products?","Uh, no if I, if I really want marijuana, I would have to go with edibles, I, I can't take the smoke."
respiratory,"OK, I see and, do you drink alcohol?","Uh just, I would say probably on the weekends I might have four or five beers."
respiratory,"OK, and, anybody else in the family have asthma or skin irritation like, like you have?","Yeah so my, my older sister actually also was diagnosed with asthma. She also has the eczema that I have and my mom was also diagnosed with asthma when she was a child, but she's been completely fine since then."
respiratory,"OK, well that's good that, that she's been OK. Does anybody in the family have any heart or, or lung conditions or any cancers that run in the family?","My grandfather died of lung cancer, but he was just, just smoked all throughout his life."
respiratory,"OK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?","Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help."
respiratory,"Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult.","Yep, sounds good."
respiratory,What brings you in?,Hi I'm here with my son and he's just been feeling awful. He just has this runny nose and he's been sneezing all the time and uh I don't know maybe he has allergies or something?

respiratory,Okay.,"But he hasn't complained about difficulty with breathing or like, he's been, like he sleeps with his mouth closed. So I think he he should be able to breathe OK."

respiratory,OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?,No.
respiratory,"No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?",Sounds great.

It's a little bit less effective as you um go past a certain age, you are still obviously nowhere close to that, but it's,  I I don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either, so it's best if you get it done earlier.

respiratory,"Uh all right, well um that's all the questions I had. We'll do a physical exam, have a look inside your throat. Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test.

respiratory,OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?,"Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?","Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back."
respiratory,"Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have.","OK, awesome, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in here?,"I've had this cough for over a week now, and it just hasn't gone away."
respiratory,"OK, and uh, so this cough has been going on for a week. Can you describe the cough a little bit for me?","Yeah, so I mean sometimes I produce sputum and sometimes I don't. It's uh, white and whiteish clear in color."
respiratory,"OK, um, and it's been going on for more than a week.Has it been getting worse?","It got a little bit worse at first, but then it's been kind of the same, um, since."
respiratory,"OK, have you noticed at all, um, like green or yellow color of your sputum or any blood tinged sputum?","Uh, No blood, and maybe a little yellowish."
respiratory,"OK, little yellowish, OK. And how much would you say you bring up, um, on an average day?","Uh, a couple of teaspoons."
respiratory,"Couple of teaspoons OK.OK, has there been anything that um, makes it worse or better?",Nothing that I can think of.
respiratory,"OK, and have you had this happen to you previously in the past?",No.
respiratory,"And is the cough uh, constant or does it come and go?","It comes and goes, uh, throughout the day. No particular time of the day it's worse."

respiratory,"OK, and how about the headache? When did that start?","So it's been, uh, kind of off and on over the past, uh, week or so. Um, feels like a like a pressure sensation and my head is just really squeezing."
respiratory,"OK, and um. So is it on one side of your head or both sides?",Both sides.
respiratory,And it's Kind of like a pressure and squeezing. Is it at all pulsating?,No
respiratory,"No? OK, Is it constant or does it come and go?",It comes and goes.
respiratory,"OK, and have you taken any medications to make any of these symptoms better?","Yeah, I have used some Advil for the headaches and over the counter medicine at night time to help sleep."
respiratory,"OK. Uh,and do you recall doing anything in the last few weeks which you might believe that Uh, caused some of these symptoms? like for example, were you in contact with anyone that was sick at all?","Well, I'm a nursing student and I've been on rotations in the hospital recently."
respiratory,"And anyone that you probably saw in the hospital, anyone sick that you were in contact with?","I did see some people who had, like, infectious symptoms."
respiratory,"OK, and other than that, have you been having any fevers or chills?","Yeah, I've felt chills."

respiratory,"OK, so any coughing at all?","Yeah, I feel it, like more, like it does hurt when when I'm coughing, that's kind of what I'm feeling it. I think it's being caused by how much I'm coughing.I kind of feel it there in the center."
respiratory,"And besides, when you're coughing, do you have any pain in your chest when you're breathing in or out?","No,"

And so we will be getting a swab done for you as well today and considering you are having these symptoms, we will also get another test done for you today to see if there's any bacteria causing what we call walking pneumonia. It's community acquired pneumonia that's fairly common in like the younger population. And so we'll see if you could have that. And so from there we'll see if we need to put you on any antibiotics which will help you. And if we need to get any blood work or X Rays we'll let you know as well. Is that OK? And if you feel like you have worsening symptoms like shortness of breath, you need to make sure you come back to the Emergency Department.","Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."

Do you think it's COVID?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so definitely at this time, you know whenever people have any respiratory symptoms we always want to rule out COVID.  So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already.","OK, sure I can do that."
respiratory,"Yeah, do you have any questions?","No, that sounds good. Thank you so much."

respiratory,"Have you taken a look into his throat? Is it red? Do you see any yellow streaking white stuff, anything like that?","I definitely did take a look yesterday and definitely saw a lot of redness. I don't know if I saw any white or yellow streaks, but definitely looks very red in there."
respiratory,"OK, do his tonsils look enlarged?","Uh, everything looks swollen in there, I don't know what's what, but it does look very angry in there."

respiratory,"OK. And, any fatigue or exhaustion?","Energy's pretty much the same, just really complaining a lot about the throat."
respiratory,"OK, OK, have you noticed any swelling in in the neck area?","Uhm, I think there might be like a few lumps near his neck, so I don't know if that's swelling, but definitely there is. There's a few that I felt over the last few days."

respiratory,"OK, um, and how about shortness of breath or wheezing?","No, nothing like that."

respiratory,Joint pain or muscle aches?,No.
respiratory,"OK, how about in nausea or vomiting?","No, no, he hasn't told me anything about that."
respiratory,Any appetite changes?,"Yeah, just with the trouble swallowing I'm trying to make sure that he gets like liquids because over the last few days he can't tolerate like solid foods at all."
respiratory,"Yeah, how about a weight loss over the past few weeks?","No, not really. t's just been over the last few days that he hasn't been eating like himself."
respiratory,OK. Alright and has he been healthy otherwise?,"Yeah, otherwise he's a very healthy child. We have rarely gone to a doctor for him before, so yeah, nothing. Nothing else with him."
respiratory,"OK, have you tried anything for his sore throat? Anything over the counter?","We did try, uh, like Tylenol cold. It helped with this headache, but it didn't really help with his sore throat"
respiratory,"OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?","No, not that I know of."

respiratory,"OK, family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?","No, no lung or heart conditions. His father does have diabetes though."
respiratory,"OK, how old was he when he was diagnosed with diabetes?",I think probably in his late 30s with type 2 diabetes.
respiratory,"Type 2, OK and then any sick contacts recently that he may have had?","I don't think at home at least, uh, but maybe at school, like you never know who they are in contact with, so I'm wondering if he just picked it up somewhere from school."
respiratory,OK.,"Yeah, yeah, they're all wearing masks right now, but I don't know if he picked something something up from his classmates."
respiratory,"Yeah for sure. OK, and then any travel to anywhere recently?","No, we've been at home, haven't left even to go to like a different city, have been in London the whole time."
respiratory,"OK, yeah, and who does he live with at home?",So he lives with myself and his dad.
respiratory,Any siblings?,"No, he's an only child."
respiratory,"OK, any reason to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering his symptoms?","You know we don't have any pets. We don't have any like old carpets, it's a fairly new apartment, so I don't think any of that should be an issue."
respiratory,"Okay, well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?","Uh, no, I think those are everything I wanted to talk about but I just was wondering if he needs to get tested or like if there's anything we can do today for him."
respiratory,"Yeah, so he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a score of right now at least three or four, or maybe even five, definitely over four, we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days. Does that sound good?","Yeah, that sounds good."
respiratory,"OK, great thank you.",Thank you.
respiratory,What brought you in today?,"Yeah absolutely. I have had this awful, awful headache for the past, two days I wanna say, its horrible."

respiratory,"OK, and has there been anything that's made the headache worse, like lights or, or sounds?","No, no, like I said it's like nothing like my usual migraine headaches."
respiratory,"OK. And, I mean, the Advil or Tylenol, It helps the symptoms for a brief period, but has there been anything else that's helped your headache?","No, not really."

respiratory,"OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?",I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having COVID.
respiratory,"Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?","Yeah, that makes sense."
respiratory,"OK great, well have a great day.","Yeah, thank you."
respiratory,How may I help you today?,"Hi, um so for the past week or so I've um I've had this cough um and some shortness of breath. I feel hot and I just feel kind of uh fuzzy like I just I can't concentrate on things very well. I get confused sometimes so I thought I'll come to you to get it checked out."
respiratory,"Yeah, yeah it's it's that was a really good idea to come in to get checked out. Um so can you uh, I'll talk I'll ask about each symptom a little bit. So starting with the shortness of breath can you um tell me how uh bad the shortness of breath has been?","Uh it's been sometimes it's not so bad, some other times it's really bad. Um at first it wasn't that bad, but now like I'm having a hard time taking a deep breath in. Um it hurts and I just feel like I can't walk like 2 blocks even before getting short of breath."
respiratory,"And uh before this week how much did, did you ever feel short of breath before this?","No, nothing like this before."
respiratory,"No, OK. Um do you feel that the shortness of breath has gotten kind of worse over time?","Yeah, I think so."
respiratory,And what about the cough? Did that start at the same time as the as the difficulty with breathing?,Um it started before the difficulty with breathing.
respiratory,"Can you, uh is it a dry cough or a wet cough?","Um it was it was a dry cough at first, but now I'm seeing some phlegm um and it looks kind of yellow."
respiratory,Have you seen any blood in the phlegm?,No.
respiratory,"Uhm and, uh, are you hearing any wheezing sounds?","Yeah, a little bit."
respiratory,"OK. Um how uh, has the cough sort of improved or gotten worse over time?",Um it's it's gotten worse.
respiratory,OK. And you mentioned you also you also have a fever. Did you check your temperature?,Um I did I it was like 38.5 this morning.

respiratory,"Okay, so yeah, there's definitely like the coughing and shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that?",No.
respiratory,"Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?",Yeah.
respiratory,What brings you in?,"Hi, I was just really worried. My son just yesterday night I noticed that he was making these grunting noises and I did notice that he was a bit warm yesterday as well, and today I, he just hasn't been himself, just very, very irritable, crying a lot. Yeah, I just got bit worried."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. What started first?","I would say the there was a little bit of coughing earlier, like yesterday. But then later on during the night, it kind of turned into this grunting noise, and he's kind of like his chest is moving a lot more when he's taking a breath in and all that."
respiratory,OK. Uhm did you measure his temperature at home?,"Yeah, so I think it was 38.5 degrees Celsius."
respiratory,"OK, and did you do that orally or rectal or under armpit?",I did it under the armpit.
respiratory,"OK. OK, uhm so you mentioned that he's had a fever, he's been grunting and he just seems a little bit more fussy. Is that right?",Yeah.
respiratory,OK is he coughing at all?,He was yesterday but not really now.
respiratory,OK and was it a dry cough?,"I think so. I mean, not-nothing really came out."
respiratory,"OK, that's good. So no blood, no sputum?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and did he seem wheezy?","Uh, no."
respiratory,"No, OK. So there's no wheezing with the grunting?","Maybe a little bit like that, just a little bit of a noise, but it's mostly the grunting."
respiratory,OK. Has he had any weight loss?,"No, not that I really, we haven't really weighed him now since his last appointment."
respiratory,OK. Does he seem excessively tired or fatigued?,"Uhm, moreso today I would say he's like earlier, he was very fussy, but now he seems a bit more tired."
respiratory,OK. Any rashes that you've noticed?,No.
respiratory,"No, OK. Uhm any changes in his vision or hearing?","Uh, no, not that I can tell."
respiratory,"No, OK. So he's responding to like sounds and he's still looking at you and things like that?",Yeah.
respiratory,OK. Have you noticed a runny nose or stuffy nose?,"Uhm, no, nothing like that."
respiratory,"No, OK. And he said he hasn't had any like fainting spells?","Uh, no, I don't think so."
respiratory,"No, OK. And how many wet diapers is he producing in a day now?",Probably 5 or 6.
respiratory,5 or 6 OK. Has that changed from before?,"No, it's pretty much the same."
respiratory,"OK, and uhm any changes to his bowel movements?",No.
respiratory,No. How about his urine?,No.
respiratory,"No, OK. OK. And then you said he was fussy, is he still eating and drinking OK?","Uh no, today he's not really taking anything in, like very fussy, very hard to feed him today."
respiratory,"OK, is he crying a lot?","Earlier today was crying a lot, but now has calm down and just I guess tired himself out."
respiratory,"Yeah, OK. Alright, and is he an otherwise healthy child?","Yeah he was, he was premature by three weeks so, Other than that like I remember when he was born they did have earlier some issues with his oxygen not being high enough and they had to like keeping, keep us in the hospital for a bit longer."
respiratory,OK.,"But yeah, after that, like there haven't really been too many concerns."
respiratory,"OK, so he's hitting all the developmental milestones like in terms of motor movements, ah speech, behaviour, all of that?","Yeah, no issues there so far."
respiratory,"OK, and how about medications? Is he on any?",No.
respiratory,"No medications, OK. And is up to date with all his immunizations?","Yeah, oh he had all his immunizations so far."
respiratory,OK. How about allergies? Does he have any?,Not that I know of.
respiratory,"No, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and does anyone at home smoke?","No, no one smokes."
respiratory,OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?,"Uh, no, not that I know of. Uhm his older sister does go to school though, but I don't know if she might have carried something home."
respiratory,"OK, how old is she?",She's six years old.
respiratory,"Six, OK. And is she healthy or is she having similar symptoms?","No, she's healthy. No, no symptoms."
respiratory,OK. Any travel recently?,No.
respiratory,"No, OK. And who does he live with at home?","Uh, so his older sister, me and his mother."
respiratory,"OK, any reasons to believe like you have old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, pets, anything like that that could worsen his symptoms?","Uh, no nothing like that."
respiratory,"OK, so I think those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns? Anything that I missed that you wanted to add?","No, I think that was all."
respiratory,"OK, uhm so for him we'll do a Covid swab just to rule that out because some of his symptoms do overlap with that. But it it's really sounding like a picture of like community acquired pneumonia, so we'll do a couple of things for him. Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia. Yeah, does that sound OK?",That sounds good. Thank you.
respiratory,What brings you in here today?,"Hey, I just, um, I just kind of came in to talk about my stuffy nose. It's yeah, it's been a problem for, I don't even know how many years it's always been there. And now that school is a little less busy and things are virtual and have more time, I decided I'll get something done, um, to get it fixed."
respiratory,"OK, and how long has this been going on for?","Since I was young, um like maybe years, couple years."
respiratory,"OK, and then do you like how often are you getting the stuffiness? Is it like every day? Is it during the day at night? When do you usually get it?","It's kind of uhm, it's kind of all the time, to the point that I've somewhat gotten used to it. And it's just my, it's only on the left side and it's just always kind of stuffy. Initially I would have trouble falling asleep 'cause it would, I would just find it a little bit bothersome, but now I'm kind of just used to it."
respiratory,"OK, and so it's just on the left side. It never moves to the right side.","Well, like sometimes when I get ill its on both sides, but usually it's on the left side."
respiratory,"OK, and so you have stuffiness. But do you ever get any kind of discharge or drainage from your nose?",Sometimes I get a little bit bleeding.
respiratory,"Are you, OK. Um, bleeding? Is it blood mixed into the discharge or drainage? Or is it like you get nosebleeds?","I get nosebleeds like maybe yeah. Like maybe when I'm exercising or something I'm like at the gym. Uhm, fom doing the gym class. Yeah, yeah when playing with my friends."
respiratory,"OK, and how often do you get these nose bleeds?",Uhm? Maybe once a month or once in two months.
respiratory,"OK. And umm, and is there any, do you have any other symptoms? So like, do you have any pressure, sensation in your face around your jaw, cheeks, forehead?",No.
respiratory,"No, so OK. And do you find yourself having more congestion when you wake up?","Uhm? Not really, maybe a little bit."
respiratory,"OK, so it's not worse when you're lying flat or anything like that?",No.
respiratory,"OK, um, and do you find that you have to constantly clear your throat at all throughout the day?","Uhm, no."
respiratory,"OK, and do you at all feel that some stuffiness drains back into your throat at all anytime during the day?","I don't think so, no."
respiratory,So it's just the congestion that's been going on for quite some time and does it change with the seasons at all?,"No, it's just there all the time. Like I can't even tell. This is like my normal now, but my mom said I should get it checked out."

Uh and some of the possible things that can be happening is you might be having a sinus issue like a chronic sinusitis. You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there.

The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though."
respiratory,"OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?",That sounds great. Thank you.

respiratory,"OK. Um, and have you been experiencing any other symptoms?","I don't know if this is just due to old age, but like I've noticed some joint pain as well, like in my hands and feet. I just assumed that was 'cause I'm getting old."
respiratory,"OK um, and has there been anything that's made the cough worse?","Sometimes when, I'm exercising a lot more but not not too much, it's kind of just always been there, hasn't really changed too much, but it's gotten more frequent over the last couple of months."

respiratory,"I'm sorry to hear that. What did you say you retired, what did you do for work previously? Did you have any exposures to chemicals or asbestos products while while at work?","Not that I remember, no it was it was a pretty, pretty much like a desk job I would say."
respiratory,"OK um, so no reasons that you were visiting farms and like being around birds or anything like that?","Um, not really, but I I do think like the old building that we lived in might have had asbestos. Does that does that like count at all?"
respiratory,"Like a it could be important, uh, because, uh, well how long, how long did you live there for?",I would say almost 20 years.
respiratory,"OK, so um, yes, that definitely would be is is important for the history today because, unfortunately, long term exposure to asbestos when breathing it in can cause some of the symptoms that you've been describing along with cough and uh, respiratory symptoms.

respiratory,"OK, so next we'll do your physical exam and order some investigations. But currently thinking that it could be related to asbestos exposure as well as um, something called, well, it could cause pulmonary fibrosis and then also the joint pains that you've been experiencing might be another symptom that is suggestive of a connective tissue disease, and it doesn't sound like you have a family history of those, but we will do some lab work and investigations for for those including a chest X-Ray and a chest CT.",Sounds good.

respiratory,"OK. Iâm going to go over this with the document I'm working with today, I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19, that will probably do a covid swab, and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms, will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there.

But just to clarify, I do get short of breath here and there sometimes I have to use puffers, but the last few days I've just been really short of breath, even even if I walk a little bit after like sit down and, can't really catch my breath."
respiratory,"OK. Alright, and do you get short of breath when you're laying down?","Uhm no, not really, it's mainly just when I'm moving around and doing stuff."

respiratory,"Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABGâs, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. Weâll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?",That sounds good. Thank you.
respiratory,What brought you in today?,"Hi, um so I've had this terrible fever for the past three days um and just before that I had a stuffy nose um and I had a sore throat, well I still do, um and it's just not going away, so I thought I should just come in and see if I have covid or what it is."

respiratory,"OK, so you're still able to swallow food, swallow liquids?","Yes, that's right."
respiratory,It doesn't feel like anything is going down the wrong way or have any coughing after you swallow?,No.
respiratory,"OK. And just in terms of coming back to this sore throat, do you feel like you have any swelling around your neck? Does it feel inflamed or swollen?",No.
respiratory,Nothing like that?,No.
respiratory,"OK, alright, excellent. So you're eating well, doing well, any changes to your bowel movements recently?","Uh no, no."

respiratory,Understood. And have you ever used IV drugs?,No.
respiratory,"OK, and when was your last menstrual period?",It was um a year ago.
respiratory,A year ago?,Mhmm.
respiratory,"OK. And then otherwise, so we talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you have the hiking trip last week and you passed some people, but it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now.",Yeah.
respiratory,"Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? Anything else you feel I should know?","No, do you think I have covid?"
respiratory,"It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?","No, I haven't."
respiratory,"So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu. But until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile.","OK, sure."
respiratory,"Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?","Alright, great thank you."
respiratory,How are you doing?,Not so well I I feel like I've been having just worsening breathlessness and a cough for it's been going on for two years now and I just can't seem to get rid of it.
respiratory,"OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?","Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time."
respiratory,"OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?","Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden."
respiratory,"OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?","Yeah, I would say so."
respiratory,OK. And was there any sort of trigger for this two years ago? Anything that you remember?,"Um, no, it kind of just started gradually on its own. No, no real triggers that I can remember."
respiratory,"OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?","Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse."
respiratory,"OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?",It's I think it's more so just I can't catch my breath and sometimes I just have trouble being able to take like a full breath.
respiratory,"OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?",It can get up to I would say like an eight sometimes when I'm doing a lot of work.

respiratory,"OK, and you mentioned it's gradually been getting worse, right?","Yeah, I would say so."

respiratory,"OK, and are you on any medications?",Just ramipril for my high blood pressure.
respiratory,"OK, um how long have you been on that medication for?","Uh, for a pretty long time, I would say more than 10 years."
respiratory,"OK and no issues, side effects with that, right?","No, and my blood pressure is pretty well controlled on that medication."
respiratory,"OK, good, um, any allergies?",No. No allergies.
respiratory,Are you up to date with all of your immunizations?,Yeah I got my shingles and my pneumonia vaccination everything like that.
respiratory,"OK, and uh, in terms of family history, um, are there any heart or lung conditions that run in the family?","Uh, so yeah, my dad had quite a few problems. He had type 2 diabetes then he suffered from 2 strokes and then he also had a heart attack uh, in I think when he was like 56. But then he actually ended up dying of bowel cancer in his 70s."
respiratory,OK. How about your mother? Is she alive? Is she healthy?,"Um, my mom is alive, but she suffered from Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure as well. And she also had, like hypothyroidism. And she also suffered from depression as well."

respiratory,"OK, um, have you been worked up for this in the past two years? Like have you had any chest X-rays or pulmonary function tests or anything like that?","No, I've never really had this issue before, so no investigations."
respiratory,"OK, OK, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?","Uh, no, I just it's been going on for two years and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past.

respiratory,"OK. Any, does he have any allergies?","Um. No, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing."
respiratory,Is he up to date with all his immunizations?,Yeah.
respiratory,"Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?",Uh no everyone is really healthy.
respiratory,"OK, and. And are there and who does he live with and where does he live?","Um he lives with just me and my husband, and he has a little sister, like this in town here."
respiratory,"OK and, is she healthy?","Yeah, I think she, yeah she's healthy."
respiratory,"OK um? Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?",No.
respiratory,"No, OK. Has he been around any sick contacts recently?","Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say."
respiratory,OK.,But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything.
respiratory,"OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?",No.
respiratory,"No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?","I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure."
respiratory,Yeah for,"yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead,"
respiratory,No go ahead.,Iâm just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit.
respiratory,"Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?","Yeah, sounds good."
respiratory,"OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection.","OK yeah, that's good to know."
respiratory,"Alright, sounds great. Have a good day.",You too thanks.
respiratory,So I understand you're having some chest tightness?,"Yeah, it's uh, for the last maybe three days, um it's not really pain, not in any specific spot, it just feels a bit tight in my chest area when I breathe in especially, and it just gets a bit harder to breathe and it feels more tight like especially when I go for my walks, which I do everyday, uh I try to walk my dog. So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out."
respiratory,"OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?",I think it's staying the same.
respiratory,"OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?","No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady."
respiratory,"OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?",Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.
respiratory,"OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?","No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight."
respiratory,"OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?","Uh, no I can't say that I did."
respiratory,"Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?","Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess."
respiratory,"OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?",Kind of just all over.
respiratory,"OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?","Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said."
respiratory,"OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?",Exactly.
respiratory,OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?,"Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing."
respiratory,"OK, any fevers?","No, can't say that, no."
respiratory,"OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?",No.
respiratory,Any chills?,No.
respiratory,Any unexplained weight loss at all?,Nope.
respiratory,"OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?","Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out."
respiratory,"OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?","Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one."
respiratory,"OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?","Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one."
respiratory,OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?,"No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning."
respiratory,"OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?","Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems."
respiratory,"OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?","Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home."
respiratory,"OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?","I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah."
respiratory,"So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?","Exactly, yeah."
respiratory,"OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?","Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication."
respiratory,"OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?","Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol."
respiratory,Yeah.,"That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril."
respiratory,Yep.,"And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often."
respiratory,"OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?","No, no."
respiratory,OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?,"No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me."
respiratory,"OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?","No, never."
respiratory,"OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?","Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that."
respiratory,"OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?","Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that."
respiratory,"OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?",Exactly.
respiratory,"OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much.","Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough."
respiratory,"OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?","Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart."
respiratory,"No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?","Sounds great, thank you."
respiratory,"No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment.",Thank you.
respiratory,So I understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today?,"Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well."
respiratory,"OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?",Yeah.
respiratory,"OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?","It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much."
respiratory,"OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?","No, this one, this one's pretty small."
respiratory,"This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?","I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous."
respiratory,"OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?","No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash."
respiratory,"OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?",No.
respiratory,Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?,"No, no, I've been fine."
respiratory,"OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?","Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else."
respiratory,That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?,"Uh no, I didn't, no."
respiratory,"OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?",Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.
respiratory,"OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?",We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.
respiratory,"OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?","No, no. I've been pretty healthy."
respiratory,"OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?",Uh just for my cholesterol.
respiratory,"OK, are you taking and medications for that?","Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one."
respiratory,"OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?",Uh no.
respiratory,So no drug allergies?,No.
respiratory,"OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?","Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked."
respiratory,OK. So no headaches?,No.
respiratory,Nothing like that?,Nothing like that.
respiratory,"OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?","No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out."
respiratory,"No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?","Great, thanks."
respiratory,Do you want to tell me what brought you in today?,"Yeah, so for the past two days I I've I've noticed that I can't smell things as well, as I used to be able to smell them and I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well. And I have this mild dry cough. I'm just worried it's covid."
respiratory,OK. You said for a couple days?,"Yes, for two days."
respiratory,"OK, have you ever had anything like this before?","No, no, nothing like this."
respiratory,"OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit? Or how? How is that working for you?","The smell isn't totally gone I can still smell something if it smells really really bad and and then and then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can taste normal things like I can't taste of banana."
respiratory,"OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?","It's been pretty consistent, yeah."
respiratory,OK. And did this dry cough that start at the same time?,Yes.
respiratory,"And when you say sorry, you said mild cough, and I my next question was do you feel like it's a dry cough or you producing any sputum? Any blood? Or is it to not, not bringing up anything?",It's dry.
respiratory,"OK, has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?",The dry cough? Um it's been pretty consistent as well.
respiratory,"OK is there, have you done anything to try to make it better? Have you taken any over the counter medications or?","No, I haven't tried anything."
respiratory,"OK, OK. Have you had, in addition to these symptoms, have you had any fevers?","Fevers, no fevers."
respiratory,"OK, any difficulty breathing?",No.
respiratory,"OK, any headaches?","Um no, no headaches."
respiratory,"OK, any sore throat?",No.
respiratory,"OK, any chills or night sweats?",No.
respiratory,"OK, any muscle ache or general weakness?",Uh no.
respiratory,"OK, so generally it seems like you're pretty well other than this loss of taste slash smell and the dry cough that correct,",Yes.
respiratory,OK and then recently have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick?,"Um no not that I can remember or yeah, not that I can remember."
respiratory,"OK, have you traveled anywhere?","Um I went hiking with my partner two weeks ago. I guess there were some people who kind of brushed by us, but other than that I don't see where else I could have gotten this from."
respiratory,"OK, was that hiking somewhere close by?","Yeah, it was like half an hour from where we are."
respiratory,OK. Are your immunizations up to date?,Yes.
respiratory,"OK, and can you think of any for this dry cough, just a circle back to that. Can you think of anything that triggers it? It's called the cold or being around certain things like cats or dogs or any other environmental things?",No.
respiratory,OK. Have you had any chest pain? Thats the other thing . I'm not sure if I asked you .,No no chest pain.
respiratory,"OK. And in terms of your general health, do you? Do you have any chronic conditions that you live with?",Um no no.
respiratory,Do you take any medications?,No.
respiratory,"OK, have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for another reason?",Um no.
respiratory,Do you have any allergies?,No allergies.
respiratory,"Do you have any family history of respiratory problems, cancers or heart problems?","No, nothing like that."
respiratory,"OK. And just in terms of free lifestyle, so do you live with family?",Um no.
respiratory,"OK, do you read along with a partner or roommate?",I live with my parents and my younger sibling.
respiratory,OK. And is that in town here?,"Yes, yeah."
respiratory,"OK. And in general, do you eat a healthy diet? Do you exercise?","Yeah, I think so."
respiratory,Do you smoke?,Uh no.
respiratory,"OK, do you drink alcohol?",Uh I I have drank alcohol before but not not regularly.
respiratory,OK um. And I do use marijuana?,Um I have taken edibles before but also not very regularly.
respiratory,"OK, any other drugs?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and are you currently in high school?","Uh yes, I am in my last year of high school."
respiratory,"OK, and how is that going?","Pretty good, yeah, we're doing things online now."
respiratory,So you haven't really been out of the house?,No.
respiratory,"OK. OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms.",Yeah.
respiratory,"Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?","No, uh thank you so much."
respiratory,"OK, well thanks for coming in today. Will definitely get you taken care of shortly.",Thank you.
respiratory,I was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency Department.,So I came to the emergency Department because I've been having pain in my chest.
respiratory,"OK, where is the pain located?",I would say it's like the whole pretty much the left side of my chest.
respiratory,"OK, and when did this pain start?","So I think it started just around 2 hours ago. I actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on, kind of just slipped and I think I fell on that side like when I the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful."
respiratory,"OK I am how would you describe the pain, sometimes people will use words like burning dull, achy.",I think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area.
respiratory,"OK, and um. Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse?","If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps."
respiratory,"OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest?","No, I would say just on the left side."
respiratory,"OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better?",I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse.
respiratory,"OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms?","Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath."
respiratory,"OK, um has anything like this ever happened to you before?","No, no. I mean, I've never had any pain in my chest before."
respiratory,"OK are you, did you have a loss of consciousness when you fell off your bike?","No, I got right back up. I just just had the pain."
respiratory,"OK, so any injuries to the head?",No.
respiratory,OK.,That's fine. I was wearing a helmet.
respiratory,"OK, excellent and any headache right now?",No.
respiratory,"OK, how about any fever chills?","No, I feel I'm fine."
respiratory,Any nausea or vomiting?,Nope.
respiratory,Do you feel as though your heart's racing?,I would say like in the last hour a little bit more so than usual.
respiratory,OK. Any skin changes or or rashes you've noticed?,"Besides, just I got some scrapes here and there on my hands, but nothing else."
respiratory,"OK, and do you have a cough?",Nope.
respiratory,"OK, and any recent infections?","No, I've been pretty pretty healthy recently. No, no cough or no infections."
respiratory,"OK, and uh, any dizziness?",Um no.
respiratory,"Alright, and I know you mentioned the few scratches on your hands, but any other injuries?","Oh no, I I think I got a pretty lucky."
respiratory,"Oh, OK. And any alcohol or drug intake prior to falling off your bike?","Oh no, no, I was completely sober. No no drugs or alcohol."
respiratory,"OK, and any weakness or numbness or tingling that you noticed?",Um no nothing like that.
respiratory,"Alright, and, when was the last time you had anything to eat or drink?","I just had some cereal and, um, just some chocolate milk around breakfast time but nothing else."
respiratory,"OK, and how many hours ago was that?",I would say around 3 hours ago.
respiratory,"OK. Um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?","Uh, not other than just a hay fever, but nothing nothing else. I have like a lot of allergies."
respiratory,Any allergies to medications?,"Oh, just sometimes when I take like a nasal spray I think I might have an allergy to the steroids that they give me and sometimes also some of the antihistamines I think I get some allergies from them."
respiratory,"OK. Uh, and any hospitalizations?","No, never."
respiratory,Any surgeries?,Nope.
respiratory,OK. Anybody in the family who have any illnesses?,Just my father. He has type 2 diabetes but nothing else.
respiratory,"OK, and how do you support yourself currently financially?","Oh so I work just as like a mechanic just in the city and currently I just have myself to support. I live alone in an apartment, so I'm doing fairly well."
respiratory,"OK, and do you smoke?","I smoke around like I'd say 2 and a half to 3 packs per day. I know it's. Yeah, I have tried quitting before, but I would say I've been smoking since I was 18."
respiratory,"OK, and do you smoke marijuana?","No, no, no marijuana, no other drugs."
respiratory,"OK, and do you drink alcohol?","Yeah, it's just like sometimes on the weekend. I'll just have a beer or two while watching the game, but not nothing regular."
respiratory,What brings you in today?,"So I've been having just a worsening breathlessness. I've been also having a cough, and I think I might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks."
respiratory,"OK, um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago, correct?",Yeah.
respiratory,OK and then when did the cough start?,"I'd say around the same time the breathlessness started, so around six weeks."
respiratory,OK. And then the fever?,The fever I've kind of had on and off in the last couple weeks. I would say two to three weeks.
respiratory,"OK, OK um and do you, how often are you having this breathlessness?","Um I would say it's pretty much there most of the time. It sometimes gets worse when I'm exerting myself, but I think just baseline, I feel like I've been able to breathe less heavily than before."
respiratory,"OK, so alright, and how long does it last when you do get it? Or is it just always there?","Uh, it's kind of just there, but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to, I would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness."
respiratory,"OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness, would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling, like you're having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you're breathing too fast?","I think it's more I just can't seem to take like deep breaths. And then when I get breathless, I I really try to take a deep breath but I just can't find myself catching my breath at that time. So it's just more not being able to catch my breath."
respiratory,"OK, sure. And are there things that make make it better or worse?","Uh, not really, I think it's sometimes moving around too much, but like nothing, nothing really causes it."
respiratory,"OK, um, and was there any sort of trigger six weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms?",Oh I'm not sure I I don't think there was any triggers.
respiratory,"OK, has anyone around you been sick?",So there there are some people living in my house that have a bad cough over the last few weeks.
respiratory,OK.,So yeah.
respiratory,So they have similar symptoms to you as well then?,"Yeah, some of them like don't really have the shortness of breath and it's just like a cough."

Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?",That sounds good. Thank you.

I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going."
respiratory,"OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.","OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you."

So today we will do a COVID swab test for you today, as a lot of the symptoms overlap and you will receive the result in the next one to two days and be contacted by public health for further instructions.

respiratory,"Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know.

I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there.","OK, thank you."
respiratory,"We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment.","Alright, that sounds good. Thank you."

I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood."
respiratory,"OK, and the cough started two years ago.",Yeah.
respiratory,"OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?","Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature."
respiratory,OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?,"Probably like a, a couple teaspoons."
respiratory,"OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?","Uh. In this it's kind of mixed into the sputum. I would say like, but it definitely is red."

One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about."
respiratory,"Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show",Sounds good.
respiratory,"OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.","OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."

respiratory,A week and a half?,"Yeah, it's kind of like a very sharp, strong pain uh when I take a deep breath."
respiratory,OK.,"But I don't notice it all the time, it's just, it's often when um I'm sitting and studying or when I'm walking, when I'm walking to school."

respiratory,"OK, did it come on suddenly? Or is it more gradual?","Yeah, it's uh, no it's it's pretty, it's pretty well, it seems the same each time.

respiratory,"OK, so it's pretty, it's not consistent throughout the day, it only happens at certain times of the day?","Yeah, it'll come on for like 20 minutes like here and there."
respiratory,"OK, anything that you think triggers it?","I don't I don't really know. Uh I was kind of worried um, I was kind of worried that it could be a heart thing, I I feel like it might it might be, it could be stress uhm but I'm I'm not really sure, my dad had a heart attack last year, he was pretty young. He's like in his 50s and it it just kind of scares me because now he's having these heart problems."
respiratory,"OK, so these chest pains last for about 20 minutes, it only happens when you take a deep breath in, and after the 20 minutes, do they come and go? Is it something that gradually weans off, or is it fairly sharp?","It seems like it kind of goes away once I, once I'm at school and like talking to people and doing other things. It's kind of when I'm, I notice it when I'm on my walks when I'm alone or like when I'm studying alone more, like maybe I have it when I'm talking to other people, but I don't really notice it."
respiratory,"OK, does it get worse with exercise?","Uh I don't think so. It just kind of, like when I'm walking to school, it kind of stays the same. I haven't done any strenuous exercise lately, 'cause I've just had so much uh schoolwork piling up."

respiratory,When did you stop smoking?,"Um so like I guess I'm trying to quit, I'm smoking less than I used to. I probably smoked 5 cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more."
respiratory,"OK, coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries?","Um it's just that I'm I'm doing my Masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just, it's very scary because I'm working on my final uh thesis and there's just a lot involved and it's it's just making me very nervous."
respiratory,"OK, is there anything special about the last couple of weeks that's made you more stressed than previously?","Uh I think just the the time crunch of having to to finish this. I've never felt like so, like there is so little time to do the work that I need to do."
respiratory,"Got it. Have you ever felt this pain before, anytime in your life?","No, no, not before this."
respiratory,"OK. So it comes on several times a day, not necessarily triggered by anything, and you said you smoke. When did you start smoking?","Um like when I was probably 18 I I sometimes smoked a little and then I smoked a little more, um maybe like 10 cigarettes a day for uh like the last two years. But then a few months ago I've been I've been cutting it in half."
respiratory,"OK, now when you get this this chest pain, do you ever feel short of breath?","Um I I think I I make myself nervous with it and then I kind of start breathing faster, but I don't have a hard, I don't have a hard time breathing otherwise, and it's hard to get a deep breath 'cause I'm, it makes me really nervous."
respiratory,Does your heart ever flutter? Feel like it's skipping a beat?,"Uhm no, only if I, only if I, if I, if I'm having kind of an anxiety attack that's felt like that before, but not any other time"

respiratory,Anything else you see your family,"I don't, oh, sorry, no nothing else. I just I thought I was kind of, when I was in high school I had those and then I really haven't for a long time. But um lately I felt like this like I could maybe get them again."

respiratory,"OK, and when you're pretty preoccupied, do you ever get the chest pain?","Um like when I'm really, when I'm work, like working with classmates or uh like thinking really like if I'm talking to someone else, I don't really get it or if I if I'm like working on a task with my hands, but it's when I'm walking and I am alone kind of with my thoughts or when I'm studying, that's when I when I get it."
respiratory,"Understood and you said your father passed early from a heart attack, I'm sorry, but anyone else in your family either your parents or mum have any health issues?","Oh he's uh he's alive, like he had a heart attack and just now he has to see a lot of heart doctors. Um no, there's nothing else in my family like that. I don't really know like about my grandpa, like my dad's dad, but like he might have also, um he just kind of, he just passed away young from um like an accident. So yeah, I'm not really sure."
respiratory,"Got it, so no one has died suddenly with no explanation when they were young or while they were swimming?",No.
respiratory,"No one's ever talked about arrhythmias, or is that a word familiar to you?","No, no, just my dad and his heart attack. That's like the only thing I know of."

respiratory,"OK, and anything that you did when you were in Mexico that might you think might have caused your cough?","Uh, I don't know, maybe I, I was drinking a little bit too much and partying a little bit too much so might have got sick while I was there."

Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away.

He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so."
respiratory,"From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me?","Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?"
respiratory,"Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes.",Ok.
respiratory,You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?,"Yeah, I don't notice that any other times."

respiratory,"OK, OK, well those were the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?","No, I I was just wondering what this can be."
respiratory,"Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."

respiratory,"OK, and how about uh physiotherapy?","Yeah, I don't know. They haven't really been coming in and I I asked the nurse and she said she's gonna look into it. Maybe something went wrong there."

respiratory,"OK. Alright, so these are all this questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination next. Do you have any questions or concerns?",No.
respiratory,"OK, so yeah, right now one of the main things we want to rule out, especially since you had the sudden shortness of breath today after a history of just recent discharge and the hip fracture or injury, and you're immobilized we need to make sure you haven't developed a clot that has traveled to your lungs. So we'll do a full physical examination and get some blood work done initially and then see if you require any medications for if you need thrombolysis for to break up the clot. We'll, we might do some imaging as well, so yeah, well, we'll just start with that, and then we'll go from there.",Sure.

respiratory,"And are you currently working, or?","I am yeah. So it's uh, yeah I work for this tech company so I've been able to do a lot of my stuff at at home."
respiratory,"OK, uhm. Have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick?","I will without, well, yeah I there a couple or last weekend. Actually there was a family party that we went to. It was outside, but uh, it, yeah, there's people around. There was nobody that was sick that I'm aware of."
respiratory,OK. And and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?,"No been besides that, the family party last weekend, but I mean that was just here in town so. It was close by."
respiratory,"OK, I guess I forgot to ask about a symptom. Have you felt that you've lost your sense of smell or sense of taste? Has it just been different?","Yeah, I said some actually now that you mention it right sense of smell has been different, which is kind of weird, 'cause I I don't have, everybody knows or I don't feel congested or anything. So yeah, but my taste has been OK."
respiratory,"Good. Well, that's all the questions I had for you. Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection and seeing that you were, you had some exposure to to other people even though they weren't sick, it could, it could be that they, they had some sort of an illness that they could transmit that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve. Or the next 14 days. So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?","No, that sounds really good, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in today?,"I can't, I can barely breathe for like 2 days now and I've been coughing and been having like a little bit of pain in my chest."
respiratory,"OK, the pain in your chest, uh can you point point out or can you describe the pain to me, is that sharp or is it dull?","Um, it's hard to say, I haven't really had this before. Um, it's more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle and it gets worse like when I cough and when I if I take like a really deep breath, it will hurt, yeah. Does that make sense?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so the shortness of breath and chest pain, they occurred simultaneously right? On the same day, like 2 days ago?","Yeah, I mean now that I think of it, I maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that. But when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that I started feeling more the pain."
respiratory,"OK, alright so let's focus on the coughing first. Are you coughing up any blood at all?","Uh, no, I haven't noticed any blood."
respiratory,OK. And how about sputum?,"I guess I guess it feels like there's some like mucus, I don't know kind, kind of like spit looking, but maybe like thicker than that."
respiratory,"OK, is it yellow?","Yeah, yeah. Yeah well yeah, it's creamy yellow."
respiratory,"OK, sure, and are you wheezing with the cough?",I I don't think so.
respiratory,"No, OK, um and is it is your shortness of breath worse with exertion?","I haven't been doing much really 'cause I've just been so wiped out. Um, till probably I guess it's kind of, I'm really, you know, haven't been getting up very much. I'm normally really active like I I train for triathlons and I I'm not like a couch potato, right? And I feel like I've been just kind of sitting down."
respiratory,"OK. Um, do you have the chest pain at rest as well, or is it just with the coughing?","Like if I take a deep breath I'll have it. But no, I don't think not not like right now. Not like just sitting here."
respiratory,"OK. And the coughing, how often are you coughing?","Oh, like it kind of varies. I feel like I get up in the night kind of sweaty and I'll cough for for a while. And it it'll keep me up, and then during the day, it's like I might go, you know, a couple hours without, but then I'll cough and I'll kind of keep going for a few minutes so, it's a lot, like probably, yeah, I probably don't go more than like 2 hours without."
respiratory,"OK, OK. And how far can you walk before you start feeling shortness of breath?","I mean, I haven't been walking very far. Like I I walked in here from the parking lot and that was fine, but I'm tired."

Kinda gross like feel like I just I feel like soaked and but yeah, I don't have a thermometer."
respiratory,"Um, OK, so these night events that you're describing, are they more chills or night sweats?","Well, I don't know, it just feels like when you know when you're, I don't like when you're a kid and you get really sick and your parent tells you have fever like I don't have an actual temperature."

respiratory,Do you drink alcohol?,"Not much, just out say one or two beers on the weekend."
respiratory,"Alright, and you use any recreational drugs like cocaine, crystal meth, or IV drugs.","No, nothing like that."
respiratory,"Alright, and has anything similar like this happened in your family before?","Uh, I think my um sister has a COPD, like she smokes a lot too. But that's that's about, I don't know if that's genetic."
respiratory,"Oh OK, um I. So I mean anybody in the family have cancers?","Um no, not that I know of."
respiratory,"Alright um so, that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?","No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this."
respiratory,"OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well.","OK, sounds good."
respiratory,So can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in here today?,"Yeah, I've noticed I've had this pretty bad cough for like the last couple of days. A little bit worried. Wanna talk to someone."

respiratory,"OK, and. I'm just going to circle back to this chest pain. You said you feel it on the right side. Is it always there or is it just when you take a deep breath or is it kind of on and off?",It's kind of always there.

Have you ever had an X Ray before?","I don't think so, no."
respiratory,Do you know what an X Ray is?,"A little bit, yeah."
respiratory,"Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?",OK.

Anything else that you wanted to tell me about that I didn't ask you.","Um. No, I guess I was just wondering why I still have a cough. It's been such a long time. Um yeah, and I was wondering if I could get any medications just to help with that. It's not really. Yeah, it's everyone's like scared at work when I cough. I have. I have had the covid test and I don't have it, um so yeah."
respiratory,When we got the last test done?,"Um I had the test done when I first started having symptoms about two weeks ago? Since then I've been at home and I'm just waiting for my symptoms to get better, but I you know, I kind of like get back, and I don't want to be coughing when I get back. Um yeah."

So you have been bringing anything up. No one in contact with these recently been sick. You don't have asthma, your not taking any medications aside from Claritin, and your little brother might have been sick about two weeks ago with kind of a common cold and we're hoping to get out of this visit is just kind of next steps and where to go from here, correct?","Yeah, like, I just want to know if I have to like take medicine or something."
respiratory,OK. Alright perfect Thank you very much. You have any more questions?,"No, I don't know. I don't have any more questions. I just like I can go home soon like lay down."
respiratory,I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.,"Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues."
respiratory,"OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?",Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.
respiratory,"OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?","Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower."
respiratory,"OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?","If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes."
respiratory,"OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?","Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave."
respiratory,"OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?","Yeah, mostly just with the cat."
respiratory,OK.,"We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it."
respiratory,"OK, and have you had a cough?","Uh, no, I don't think so."
respiratory,"OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?","Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now."
respiratory,"OK, how many days per week are you using that?","Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an ""s"", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one."
respiratory,"OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?","Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said."
respiratory,OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?,Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?
respiratory,"Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?","When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times."
respiratory,OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?,When I was a kid but not really now.
respiratory,"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?",No.
respiratory,OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?,"Ahh, I don't I don't think so."
respiratory,"OK, any urinary problems?","Uh, like. No, no."
respiratory,OK. Bowel problems?,"uh no, no. No, that's all good."
respiratory,"OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?",What's that?
respiratory,"So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating.",Oh no.
respiratory,OK.,Um not that.
respiratory,"OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?","No, no that's it."
respiratory,"OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?",Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.
respiratory,"OK, and any surgeries?",Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.
respiratory,"OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?","Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin."
respiratory,"OK, and any allergies?","What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats."
respiratory,"OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy","Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime."
respiratory,"OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?","I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything."
respiratory,"OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?","You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother."
respiratory,OK.,Yeah.
respiratory,"OK, and um, where do you go to school?","Um to to the. The school, um like high school down the road."
respiratory,OK and in what grade now?,"And, I'm in Grade 11."
respiratory,"OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?","I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?"
respiratory,"Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?","Uh, what is that?"
respiratory,"So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device.",Is that like when you breathe in that the tube?
respiratory,"Yeah, exactly.","Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back."
respiratory,"OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?","I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot."
respiratory,"OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?",Sorry I missed that.
respiratory,Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?,"Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal."
respiratory,"OK, and are you currently sexually active?","Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started."
respiratory,"OK, and do you use a condom?","Yeah, yeah."
respiratory,Every time or sometimes?,"Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah."
respiratory,"OK, great and um have you had any other partners?","No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one."
respiratory,"OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?",Uh no.
respiratory,"OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?",No.
respiratory,OK.,No I haven't.
respiratory,"OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?","Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now."
respiratory,"OK, and any allergies that run in the family?","Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies."
respiratory,"OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma.","Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that."
respiratory,Excellent.,K thank you.
respiratory,"OK, how old are you Rob?",I'm I'm 50 I'm gonna be 50 soon.
respiratory,"OK, OK, when did this start?","Well, like last night I kinda had like an ache on my chest, kind of like here like on the left. I just I didn't do anything really last night and you know I just went to sleep and I got to sleep fine like I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts. And I feel like I can't like catch my breath like I can't get a good like a good breath in."
respiratory,"Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?","Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp."
respiratory,OK.,I have never had anything like this before.
respiratory,"No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?","Um, I don't, I don't know, um. Like I can breathe right now, I can't get like a deep breath, like..."
respiratory,"Does it? Oh sorry, go ahead.",Maybe like you know five or six.
respiratory,"OK, OK. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in?",Yeah.
respiratory,Yeah?,"Yeah, it's like it's like sharp."
respiratory,"OK, sorry, sounds like you're having some pleuritic chest pain. Do you have any coughing associated with that?",No no.
respiratory,No? You're not coughing up any blood?,No.
respiratory,Any swelling in your legs?,I I don't think so.
respiratory,"No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse?","Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after."
respiratory,"OK, how about when you're laying down?","I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy..."
respiratory,OK. How about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?,I don't think so.
respiratory,"OK, how about fevers or chills?","No, not that I've noticed, no."
respiratory,OK. Any abdominal pain?,"Uh, no, no, it's like it aches kind of it, but it's all up here and like kind of in my back a little bit."
respiratory,"OK and, do you think anything triggered this?",I don't know.
respiratory,"No? OK. And you said this has never happened to you before, right?","Right, yeah."
respiratory,Does it get better with you sitting forward?,"I don't know, like I, I feel like that it's still kind of aching like it doesn't, it's not really like changing very much."
respiratory,"OK. OK. OK, any changes in your vision, hearing or smell?",No.
respiratory,No? Any rashes?,No.
respiratory,No? Weight loss?,"I, I mean, I've been trying to to lose weight."
respiratory,OK.,They told me a year ago I have like high blood pressure so I've been cutting out like salt and trying to walk more.
respiratory,"OK, OK, good.",So I've lost like 15 pounds but like not... Like I've been trying to.
respiratory,"OK, OK. 15 pounds, that's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or you feeling faint?","No, just like a I can't get like a good breath."
respiratory,"OK, and are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?","No, that's that's like it. I've never had any like chest problems."
respiratory,"OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?","No, no, they just they just put the thing on my arm. But my doctors office and said that it was high. So they said to you know, eat better and I don't I don't wanna start any drugs so, I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since."
respiratory,"OK, so you're not on any medications?","No, just yeah, no that's it. I mean I, you know sometimes take like a Tylenol if I'm"
respiratory,And do you smoke?,"I, like I, smoke a little bit. Maybe like a pack a week."
respiratory,"A pack a week, OK? For how long?",Oh like since college.
respiratory,"OK OK. Um, do you smoke marijuana?","Uh. No, no and I I smoke, I'm trying to smoke less, you know, since they told me I have the high blood pressure. So I used to smoke a little more but this is this is less but not since I've been having trouble breathing. Is it, yeah."
respiratory,"Yeah, OK. Any other recreational drugs?",No no.
respiratory,"No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?","Oh like, maybe you know, a beer on the weekend."
respiratory,"OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?",Like I don't I think I got all the ones when I was like a kid. What else should I have?
respiratory,"OK, so like the flu vaccine every year?","Oh, I get that, like my wife, my wife makes me get that."
respiratory,OK that's good. Any family history of lung or heart disease?,"Oh like my, uh, my mom and dad have high blood pressure too, so I wasn't surprised when I heard that I did."
respiratory,"OK. OK. Um, OK so Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?","I am really like nervous 'cause I haven't felt anything like this before. Um, like it's scary, like do you think it's like cancer or something like I don't I don't really know?"
respiratory,"Um, I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's it started pretty suddenly, um, like it started a day ago, correct?",Mhm.
respiratory,"Yeah, so it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know? And, but it could it could be a number of things like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism, but you said you don't have any swelling. Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work and then we'll do some imaging like a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test if indicated, and so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Sounds good?","Yeah yeah, I just really want to get a good breath so yeah, whatever we can do."
respiratory,"Yeah for sure, and then in the meantime we'll keep monitoring you to make sure your vitals are OK and if we need to give you oxygen, we will.",That'd be great.
respiratory,How may I help you?,"I'm I'm here because I, I've oddly been feeling really short of breath and have a fever or and a cough."
respiratory,"OK, when did the shortness of breath start and are you short of breath now?","It started about uh, I guess I could start yesterday. And a little bit, but it's getting better."
respiratory,"Started yesterday, OK, well I'm glad, it's getting better. When did the cough start?",It started around the same time.
respiratory,"OK, it is it. A dry cough or or wet cough?",It's a dry cough.

respiratory,"Alright, have you brought up any, I know you said its been but have you brought up any blood?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and have you had any wheezing?",No.
respiratory,OK. And you mentioned a fever as well. Have you checked your your temperature today or yesterday?,"Yeah, it was at 38 last night."
respiratory,Are you feeling feverish today as well?,"Yeah, a little bit."
respiratory,"OK, and uh. So have you had any any infectious symptoms, like runny or red eyes?",No.
respiratory,How about a runny nose or feeling congested?,"No, no, it's just a cough."
respiratory,"Cough? OK. And what what, were you around any triggers yesterday or like around any anything that was out of the normal for you?","I got a notice that this happens to me every time I go to my boyfriend's place, so I started dating, I started dating someone new about six months ago and every time I go to his place, a couple hours later I just like develop these symptoms, just kind of odd. I thought that I was just getting a cold. But now that it's happened like three times, I'm thinking maybe you have some sort of an allergy like maybe,  I don't know. Maybe it's like yeah, I'm just allergic to something. Maybe his plants or something. I don't know."
respiratory,"OK, and it does this happen each time that you go go to his house?","Um, yeah, yeah. Kind of almost yeah, that's like you haven't like. I haven't been to his place very often because of the pandemic. But yeah, every time I go kinda feel really crappy after."

respiratory,"OK, and you've been fatigued as well?",Oh yeah.
respiratory,OK. Have you had any headaches?,No.

respiratory,"OK, any allergies to medications you're aware of or or environmental things like or dust or pollen?","No no. Which is why I was kind of surprised. I'm usually fine and I spend a lot of time outdoors so, I don't know. Yeah, I was surprised when this happened when I went to his place."
respiratory,"OK, did you ever get these kind of symptoms if you are like yeah or around smoke or or anything like that, you could maybe be inhaling or or even if you are outside in the cold?",No.
respiratory,"OK, and you get seasonal symptoms like throughout the year you get like itchy runny eyes or like. Like a runny nose?","No, no. That hasn't happened to me."
respiratory,"OK, and do you take any medications?",I just take a birth control pill.
respiratory,"And when, how long have you been on that for?",About three years.
respiratory,OK. And any prior surgeries or hospitalizations?,Oh no.
respiratory,"Alright, and can you tell me a little bit about where you're living currently and two you're living with?","I live alone, uh? I have an apartment next to the University."
respiratory,"OK, and any potential for being around anybody who's been sick like your boyfriend or his family or or anywhere else?","No, I've just been visiting him and I just go grocery shopping. I've just I've been doing schooling online. Yeah, I don't think so. I'm usually very careful, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not maintaining social distancing with my boyfriend. He's in my social circle, but yeah, other than that no one I think yeah."

respiratory,OK. And so I wanted to ask about the boyfriend's house as well. Is there any pets in the home there?,"Oh yeah. Yeah, he has this cute little parrot. And he also has a cat."
respiratory,"OK, and do you have any pets at your house?","No, no I don't."
respiratory,"Oh, OK. So that I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on on history today, was there anything else I forgot to mention or you wanted to to bring up?","I don't think so, no."
respiratory,"OK, so it sounds like there's potentially could be caused by an allergen such as which could be   from an animal like a parrot or a cat that is causing just a reaction and it's bringing these symptoms on like called hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but also we can't rule out asthma as well as being a trigger of kind of the cough and shortness of breath is being around allergens as well, so we'll order pulmonary function test, and maybe some, uh, uh, imaging and chest x-ray and we will go from there.","Great, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you in?,"I've just had a real like a real bad cough. Umm, it's been going on for 4 or 5 days now umm, and I'm just, I'm having some trouble breathing. I'm coughing up like gunky green stuff. Uhm, yeah, it's just really bad. I haven't had anything like this before."
respiratory,"OK, so when did the cough start?",About four or five days ago.
respiratory,"Four or five days ago. OK, and, uhm OK. So for 5 days, did you do have any shortness of breath with that?","Yeah, it's uh, I'm just I feel like I can't, can't quite like breathe fully."
respiratory,"OK, uhm you can't quite breathe fully, so like when you take a deep breath in, you can't expand your lungs fully. Is that what you mean?","Yeah, yeah, I just overall I just feel like yeah, I'm I'm short of breath. I guess that's the best way to put it."
respiratory,"OK, so you're short of breath. And how about wheezing? Do you have any of that?",I don't think so.
respiratory,OK. So when did this start again? You said if a couple days ago or a few weeks ago.,I think it was four days ago.
respiratory,"Four days ago, OK, and did you have like a runny nose or stuffy nose at that point?",Maybe a little bit. I wasn't really thinking about it too much.

respiratory,OK.,"Just like just fatigued like more than usual, yeah."
respiratory,OK. Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?,"Uhm, I don't I don't have too much luckily, knock on wood. Uhm, I, I take a medication for my reflux."
respiratory,Mhmm.,"And I did, I did have a knee replacement, five years ago."
respiratory,OK.,"Other than that, like I don't, I haven't really been to the doctor for much."
respiratory,OK. Uhm alright. Do you have something called COPD?,No.
respiratory,"No, OK. Uhm, are you on any medications?","Just that one for the reflux its uhm oh, it starts with an R. Uhm, Rabeprazole?"
respiratory,OK.,Yeah.
respiratory,Alright and are you up to date with all your immunizations?,"Uh, yeah."
respiratory,Including like the pneumovax vaccine and the shingrix?,I had the shingrix the pneumo I think the doctor said we were going to look at that the next time I came in.
respiratory,"OK, sure.","So I I'm not sure I I know that I always say yes to these things, but I'm not sure because of Covid and stuff if I've been getting everything exactly on time."
respiratory,"Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?","Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything."
respiratory,"OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?","No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside."
respiratory,"OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?","No, no"

Although in the past you know few days, I just 'cause I felt really rundown and fatigued, I haven't been eating as much as I normally do."
respiratory,OK.,"Otherwise, I think we pretty healthy I try to, you know, follow healthy recipes and find them online."

respiratory,"OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?",I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?","Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on."
respiratory,"Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet.","OK, OK, that's good to hear."
respiratory,"Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you.","OK, thank you."
respiratory,What brings you here today?,"Um hi, yeah I've had the stuffy nose um that's been on and off, as well as a runny nose for the past week and it doesn't seem to be getting any better, so I thought I should come in and get it checked out in case I have covid."
respiratory,"OK, yeah I know for sure that's a good idea. So how long have you had this for?",A week now.
respiratory,A week. And did. So what started first? Was it the runny nose? Or like the stuffiness?,"It felt pretty stuffy at first, but now it's mostly running."
respiratory,"OK, and are you coughing at all?",No.
respiratory,"No OK, and the runny nose what kind of content are you producing or draining? Is it mainly like clear or is there any color to it?",It's mostly clear.
