musculoskeletal,"OK, so that that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and look for on the physical today. Did you have anything else that perhaps I forgot to mention that might be important?","Uhm no that was kind of it, I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow."
musculoskeletal,"I yeah certainly so. It will be so when I get an elbow X Ray. And. But typically to fix this type of injury, so currently I'm thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation, and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely I radial head subluxation, where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that the what could happen is the part of the radius, which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in here today?,"I've been having this pain in my knee and it's been going on now for a few weeks. It's kind of right at the, I could feel it right below my kneecap and at first it it was really only bothering me after activity, but now it's starting to hurt during as well, and so it's, it's trying to limit my ability to play basketball."

musculoskeletal,"Yeah, it take you. OK, and does the pain travel anywhere else or does it, it's just right below your kneecap?","It's right below my kneecap, yeah I feel like it's just over a kind of a small area it's a pretty specific spot and if I press on that area at all it gives me a pretty, it's a sharp pain if I if I press on it sharp pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And on a scale of zero to 1010 being the worst pain you felt in your life, how much would you rank the rate this pain?",I it's about about a six or seven.
musculoskeletal,"Six or seven OK. And is it a constant pain, or like do you get the pain when you're not playing basketball or doing other activities?","Um I'll get it if I'm. Like sometimes I'll feel it if I'm going upstairs like walking upstairs or. Like if I'm sitting for a long, long time and I I get up, it'll feel a bit sore. But it's mostly if I'm like doing activities like running or jumping, doing like strenuous stuff like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK I see, an has this ever happened before?","No, I haven't had any any issues with my knee before."

musculoskeletal,"OK, and uh. Have you tried anything that improves the pain at all or anything that makes it worse?","Um I I have tried taking some like Tylenol and Advil and that or or and NSAIDs that and it has helped with the pain.

musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so yeah, those are some questions I had. I just have a few more questions with regards to just examining your knee. Are you able to walk or do you have any kind of a limp?",No limp I can. I can walk OK.
musculoskeletal,OK and are you able to run?,"Yeah I can. I can run, but when I do it it causes some pain. I'm able to still run but yeah it it hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK and. So when you palpate your lower knee just under the patella, you said it's a sharp pain, right?","Yeah exactly and then when I it's, and it feels kind of achey or when when, like after practice or something like that, but if you press on it it it's sharp."
musculoskeletal,"And, uh. Any any kind of like are you able to flex and extend your knee right now if you tried?",I can yeah.
musculoskeletal,OK and have you noticed any kind of rotation of your knee at all?,"No, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"No OK. OK, and no weakness below your knee, right?","No weakness. I just feel like my muscles are really tight like my fly and my hamstring muscles. Think I need to stretch them out some more, they do just feel tight."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you notice any kind of swelling or redness or bruising in the area?",No.
musculoskeletal,"no OK, and your ankle and hips you don't have any pain or issues with movement, right?","No, not at all. No, no problems with my ankle or hip."
musculoskeletal,OK alright yeah. So those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions?,I was just wondering what I can do to make this go away.
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so definitely this is something that is what we call Jumpers knee. It's fairly common, uh, amongst younger athletes, especially those that play sports like volleyball or basketball. But right now we don't really need to do any kind of imaging or anything like that. It seems like you're in the earlier phases and it's good that you came in. We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day depending on if you're taking extra strength Tylenol for example versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of a teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help what we call like that you will you might be having is just um some inflammation in your patellar tendon, right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy and then we'll see how you you do based on all those treatment options and then if it gets worse and if or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an MRI and then see where to go from there. But for now does that sound OK with you?","It does, yeah, thank you. So you said that you think it's like a patellar tendonitis or something like that?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, it's patellar tendonitis is commonly called the jumpers knee and it should resolve with the steps that we, especially since it seems like you're in the earlier stages. So it seems like it should be pretty responsive, but if it isn't, there are other steps we can discuss in the future.","OK, that sounds great. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"Um, hi, I'm here with my daughter. Uh, we noticed that uh, since yesterday she's been having this pain just in her elbow. Um, and like today, we've noticed right after she woke up, she's been in pain and also just keeping her elbow like protected, um, kind of like just flexing it and just holding on to it. So I think it's uh, giving her a lot of discomfort and she's been crying as well."
musculoskeletal,"Oh yeah, for sure. Um, when did this start?","I think it started, uh, after we went for a walk last uh, evening. Um, and we just went to the park and since then like she's been having that pain."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, okay, and did anything happen to trigger this? Did she fall on that arm? Or like, injuries?","Um, I think like just uh, she was playing and then um, she was about to fall like right, like right on to the playground pavement. So I remember like, but like I caught her right away, so to protect her, and then since then, I don't know if like there was like a jerk movement as like I kind of pulled her back up, or um, when I was stopping her from falling, like if that caused it. But she didn't hit herself or anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Alright, um, and in terms of the type of pain she's having right now, did she say if it was a dull, achy kind of pain, or is it sharp?",She says it's aching a lot.
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and has it been constant since she um, started experiencing this? Or does it come and go?","It's, it's been pretty constant since then and yeah, she just kind of keep, keeping, she's kind of keep, just keeping it like, her arms extended um, and then yeah, just holding on to it."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Um, and then, is the pain just in the elbow, or does it radiate down into her hands or up to her shoulders?","Um, it kind of goes into her upper arm, like from her elbows to her upper, upper arm."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, have you tried anything for this pain?","Uh, no, I haven't tried any medications or anything. I just wanted to come in before I tried anything."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst type of pain, how bad is this pain for her?","I would say it's probably, at least a 7."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and then um, has she ever experienced pain like this in the past?","Um, no. This is the first time."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Um, and then does she have any numbness or tingling in the area?","Um, no, not that I know of."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about memory loss or confusion?",No.

musculoskeletal,"Um, how about changes in urine?","Um, no. No, no changes."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and is she otherwise healthy? Does she have any longstanding medical conditions?","She's been healthy so far, no concerns at all."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and um, with her mother's pregnancy with her, were there any complications at that point?","Um, no, it was like a normal pregnancy, no complications. She was born at 39 weeks, like with vaginal delivery, didn't have to stay in the hospital or anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and no issues as a neonate?","Uh, no, she, we were able to bring her home pretty quick."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, that's good. Um, and then, she hasn't had any hospitalizations or surgery since then?","No, no surgeries or hospitalizations."
musculoskeletal,"Alright, his she on any medications?","No, no medications."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, um, is she up-to-date with her immunizations?","Yeah, we've had, we've got all the immunization."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about allergies? Does she have any?","Um, no allergies."

musculoskeletal,"Okay, that's good. Has she come in contact with anyone sick recently?","Um, no."
musculoskeletal,Have you done any travel recently?,Nope.
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Alright, and those are all the questions I had for history taking. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Um, I'm just going to get you to take a look at both her elbows and arms. Do you see any, um, redness or swelling in the right elbow compared to the left?","No, I don't see that. No, I don't see any changes."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about um, any muscle atrophy, deformities, or skin changes, like bruises?","Um, no, I don't see anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. How about, um, when you palpate her elbows, does, is she in pain?","Um, she doesn't really let me, but if I try to, I think that does cause her some pain."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about when you palpate her like forearm muscles?","Um, no, not as much."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about her biceps and triceps?","Um, no, not really."
musculoskeletal,"No, okay. Um, alright, and those are all the questions that I kind of had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?","No, I just wanted to find out if she broke something, or like, yeah, I didn't know what was going on."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Yeah, it seems like someone of her age and just the kind of history that you're giving me, it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation. Um, and that's usually caused in young children when they're like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while their arm is held straight, um, which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit. Um, so um, in terms of like a management plan, you can try conservative things like ice packs, um, over the counter painkillers. Um, otherwise, we can try to um, put the radius back into its normal position here, which will just take uh, like a few minutes. Um, and, and then after we reduce it back into its place, um, she should have normal function of her arm again. Um, if she's still experiencing pain, we can continue keeping it on a splint, um, but otherwise, I don't think we need any imaging for this at this um, at this time. So did you have any questions or any concerns about that?","No, I think that's, um, that's a good plan."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, great. Um, thank you.",Thank you.
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"I'm I'm here because my right knee is very painful. It looks kind of swollen and it's it's also a little bit warm so I'm just worried, I'm worried about it and I was wondering if you could look at it."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly, um. So where are you feeling the the pain exactly?","So it's where, so right in the middle of my knee. So just below the bone that, the big knee bone."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so like underneath the kneecap, like below that?",Yeah just just a little bit below.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so slightly below the Patella. Sounds like somewhere in the region of the tibial through tuberosity.",Right.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and when did this pain start?",It started about two weeks ago.
musculoskeletal,"OK, two weeks ago when the pain started, was there any trauma or could you remember any movement that that caused the pain?","Nothing like that, but I recently found out that I had some osteoarthritis on my left knee, so I was trying to put more pressure on my right knee one whenever I was doing like gardening work um and I think something something may have happened when I was doing that, something maybe, maybe I put too much strain on it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see an. Alright, like are you doing a lot of kneeling on on or during the gardening work?",I am.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um, and. How long has the pain been going on for, has it been constant over these two weeks?","Yes, it has been."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how would you describe the pain, is it sharp, burning, achy?","I would say mostly achy, but it can be sharp."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you feel the pain radiate anywhere else?","No, just it's pretty local."
musculoskeletal,"OK, have you tried anything to make the pain better?","I tried some topical like what are those like ice and fire gels. Those seem to help temporarily, but the pain comes back."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And. Have you tried, has anything made the pain worse?","I guess like when I kneel down on it, it gets painful or If I touch it or palpate it, I guess painful if I'm I'm flexing my knee too much that hurts as well. Kind of keeping it straight and not touching it makes it feel better."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and. What would you say the severity of the pain is with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt and one being the least pain?",I give it about a 6.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and have you had a pain like this in your right knee before?","No, nothing like this and I have osteoarthritis in my left knee but it feels different."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and um. OK, and have you had any fevers or chills?","Uhm, no."

musculoskeletal,OK. And have you been around anybody who's been sick recently?,No.
musculoskeletal,And have you traveled anywhere recently?,No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, are you currently working right now?",I yes I am.
musculoskeletal,"OK, well then what what do you do?",I work as a full time gardener for a landscaping company.
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. So you're spending a lot of time doing kind of like repetitive kneeling type movements to do your job?","Yes, that's right."
musculoskeletal,OK And do you smoke cigarettes?,I don't.
musculoskeletal,"Alright, and do you drink alcohol?",I'll have a glass of wine every other night.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you use any recreational drugs?","No, I don't."
musculoskeletal,Have you used anything like that in the in the past.,No
musculoskeletal,"like IV drugs, no, OK. And in the family or is there a history of any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK. So next I just wanted to do the physical exam portion and ask you to have a look at the knee first and let me know if the if you're having any swelling, redness or warmth to the knee compared to the other side.",Sure.
musculoskeletal,"Sorry so you are having, having swelling, warmth and redness to the right knee?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,OK and are you having pain to like palpation is there a specific spot you can press on that causes a sharp pain?,"Um so just below that kneecap area there is some swelling there and when I press down on that swollen area, it causes a bit of pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And are you able to fully bend, bend and straighten the knee?","I can do that, but when I bend my knee it really hurts."
musculoskeletal,OK. And are you able to walk normally or do you have a limp?,"Um I can walk normally, it just hurts."
musculoskeletal,OK. So that was a everything that I wanted to ask today on the history and and physical. Was there anything? That you maybe I forgot about you wanted to add?,"No, I don't think so."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so right now it's sounding like this could possibly be a knee Bursitis. Or Prepatellar, or sorry, infra patellar bursitis or a prepatellar bursistis which are the kind of the more common types. One thing to make sure that we rule out would be a septic Bursitis. Although you're not having any fevers or chills so that makes it a little bit less likely.",Mmmm
musculoskeletal,"But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever, it's becoming even more painful then certainly will have to rule out infection. And as well if things are not improving, potentially a structural disease and any, such as a meniscal injury, or like a ligamental injury from all of the like kneeling and and repetitive movements. But right now I think it's mostly sounding like a knee bursitis.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and treatment for that will be activity modification as well as using things like as um NSAIDS and icing to help with um the inflammation.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"I just came in because of I just got into like this uh, incident while I was playing rugby. I kind of got tackled and then fell onto my right shoulder.

musculoskeletal,Changes in your bowel movements?,No.
musculoskeletal,Changes in voiding?,No.
musculoskeletal,"Um, okay. And then with regards to this pain, does anything make it better or worse?","Um, um not anything that I've tried that's made it better. Worse is probably just if I try to move it at all."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and the pains in your shoulder, does it radiate down or up elsewhere?","Uh, mostly towards my shoulder, um, kind of down towards my upper arm as well."

musculoskeletal,"Okay. And um, have you traveled anywhere recently?","Um, no, I've been at home."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, any sick contacts?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, okay. So now we're just going to move on to um, the physical exam part of this. So can you take a look at both your shoulders and let me know if you see any redness or swelling?","Um, I don't think I see any redness or swelling, but um, my right shoulder and my arm just seems a little bit lower than my left one."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, okay, any um, warmth on, on that shoulder?","Uh, no, not that I can feel."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?","Um, deformity, I, I do feel like kind of uh, like my shoulder's dropped and like there's just kind of this uh, little, like divots, where like the shoulder should be."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, okay. And can you palpate that area for me? Just um, the bones in that area, so like right where your arm would connect to your shoulder and then kind of on your shoulder blade. Does that hurt when you press down?","Yeah, it hurts a lot."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, so some tenderness and pain in the acromion process and scapula. Um, and if you press down on your biceps, triceps, does that hurt?","Not as much, no."

musculoskeletal,"Alright, so um, it sounds like you have a shoulder dislocation. Um, so we are going to do an x-ray of your shoulder joint first to make sure that it's, it's just a dislocation and there aren't any broken bones or fractures. And then um, we can resolve this by doing something called a closed reduction, um, to try to put the joint back in its place.",Okay.
musculoskeletal,"Um, and if that closed reduction doesn't work, then uh, you may need surgery for like a, um, a weak shoulder joint, or if like ligaments um, aren't like, strong enough and it's it continues to happen.",Okay.
musculoskeletal,"Um, otherwise, we can keep it immobilized for a few days to a few weeks, um, depending on how bad the dislocation is. Um, and then once that's removed, you can do some rehab as well to restore some range of motion. Does that sound like a good plan? Do you have any questions or concerns in the meantime?","Uh, no, I think that's, uh, that's great."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"Hi, I've been having this back pain for the past month, so I'd just like something for it an and you know image it if possible just to figure out what it is."

musculoskeletal,"So one month ago when it started before then, did you injure yourself at all or, were you doing anything that brought on the pain or did the pain come on gradually?","So I work in this factory where I move a lot of boxes and I think I may have like lifted a really heavy box or lifted it in an improper position because that's when, that night is when my back started hurting."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see and how long have you worked in this role?",For the past 30 years.
musculoskeletal,OK Alright. And has the pain become worse at all or has it stayed the same since it started?,I'd say it's pretty. It's been pretty similar to the start.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And does the back pain move anywhere, like for example does it shoot down your legs at all?",No OK. Have you tried anything that has helped you?
musculoskeletal,"OK. And what kind of things make your pain worse like, bending down as opposed to stretching backwards?","Yeah, bending down like it when I flex my back that hurts more than if I straighten it out."

musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so I'm just gonna ask a few questions, maybe get you to do some movements and see what hurts the most.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"So when you press your hand down, down your spine. Is it hurt at all in the lower back with palpation?","Um it kinda hurts right in the middle, uh, just above the buttocks area an where like my tailbone almost is"

musculoskeletal,And does it hurt in the lower back or near the front of your hips?,That hurts in my lower back.
musculoskeletal,"And any kind of redness or swelling that you've noticed at all? I know it's in the back, so it might be more difficult to see.","Um no, I don't see anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And are you, has your gait, changed at all, or is it, are you able to walk without a limp or anything?",I'm able to walk without a limp.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so and then, uh, bending down you said hurts more than standing up or extending your back, right?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions for me?","No, just like how can I treat this?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your work having been lifting heavy objects for the last 30 or so years it's usually something that occurs with repetitive, repetitive work, and strenuous work like that that affects your back. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is no red flags that were too worried about right now with your back pain we can wait to get some imaging. But first we would just like to try some of the conservative management. Is that OK with you?","Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in here today?,"So my back has been killing me it's been hurting for the past two months, but recently it's gotten worse. I'd say over the past week or two weeks it's gotten really bad and no over the counter medication is helping with the pain. It's I'm finding it hard to walk. I can't feel anything in the groin area and I'm having so many bladder accidents."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and so this pain started two months ago, but it's progressed to like these other symptoms as well?","Yes, that's right."
musculoskeletal,"Started your lower back OK and does the pain, how would you describe the pain, is it like aching. sharp?",It's sharp.
musculoskeletal,"OK and did anything happened prior to the pain, any injuries at all that you experienced?","Two months ago I was in a motor vehicle accident um an I think my back started hurting then but they did some imaging it's and turned out like one of the discs there was a slip in a disc or something, but at that point the pain was just achey and I don't really have any in any of these other issues. But over the past two weeks it's gotten sharp and I'm having all these other symptoms."
musculoskeletal,"OK, um and. So you're having the set like what's called, some numbness in your groin. Is that unilateral, like on one side or both sides?","Uhm, it seems like it's both sides."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and. So and then you're also having the urinary incontinence. How long is that been going on for?",The past week.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and what about the numbness in your groin area?",That's been going on for the past week as well.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and OK, and how would you describe your pain right now on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt?",Um I would say it's like an 8 or 9.
musculoskeletal,"Eight or nine OK, and does it get worse with any, any motions at all?","I think it's worse with um, I don't know like, it's worse with anything, anytime, anytime I tried to move it, it hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so you just improved with rest complete rest.",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Does it travel in, does the pain travel anywhere else, does it shoot down your legs at all?","Yeah, so it does shoot down my legs and I'm having a hard time walking because of that."
musculoskeletal,Is it both legs or just one?,"It's mostly on my right, but the left one isn't the same as it used to be either."
musculoskeletal,OK,"Yeah, I'm having a hard time like getting up from a chair and things like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and anything that you've tried that has helped relieve some of your symptoms.",I've tried like over the counter counter and ibuprofen. I've tried some topical analgesics and nothing seems to be working.
musculoskeletal,OK. And. Have you experienced any trauma? So you mentioned you had a car accident rate two months ago?,"Yes, that was. Yeah, that was two months ago."
musculoskeletal,"OK and then. Were you in the hospital, admitted to the hospital for for a while, or how, what happened in your treatment?","Yeah, I was. I was taken to the ER. They did like a full work up on me. The only thing on my back that they found was a slipped disc and then they said that should that shouldn't cause me too much pain. But if I was having any of these symptoms that I'm having now I should go back, or see a doctor at least. And and otherwise I was fine like I didn't lose a lot of blood or I didn't need any surgical interventions at that point."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. And have you been having any other symptoms or any any pain in any other joints or muscles?","Uhm, No, no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any fevers or chills.",No.
musculoskeletal,Any night sweats?,No rashes or skin changes.

musculoskeletal,OK so you have muscle weakness. Is it just one like that's ah weak or both legs?,So both like seem weak but the right more than the left.
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. Uhm, and does this weakness seem to get worse, or is it around the same as it was when it started?",It's it's it feels like it's getting worse.
musculoskeletal,"OK, do you have any past medical conditions you have been diagnosed with?","I had hypothyroid, so I've been taking Synthroid for that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any other medications?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, any allergies to any medications?",No.
musculoskeletal,OK. Any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?,No.
musculoskeletal,Any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions?,Um no.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Currently, do you work?","I do. I work from home right now, I'm a teacher."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uh. And do you, did you do any work previously that required heavy lifting or strenuous activities regarding your back at all.","Um no no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,And what's your home and living situation like right now?,I live at home with two of my children.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And are you able to do things at home that you were before look like, or do you need some extra help from it, your family members, or extra help from other workers. Anything like that?","Yeah, my family's definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because. Yeah, like I said, like I'm having some weakness in my legs. I can't move around as much because I'm in so much pain. Um and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so. Yeah, they've been helping me out with everyday things."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. And currently, do you smoke?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, do you drink alcohol?",No.
musculoskeletal,And any recreational drugs like marijuana?,No.
musculoskeletal,OK. I'm just getting at you to do a few things on just just as part of the physical examination.,Sure.
musculoskeletal,"Are you able to bend down or extend your back at all, or is it too painful?","Yeah, I can't do that. It's too painful."
musculoskeletal,"Do you notice any kind of redness, swelling in and around your back?",Um not that I can tell.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how about if you press down on the your lower back, does it hurt?","Yeah, that hurts."
musculoskeletal,OK. And are you experiencing the numbness right now and in your groin area?,I am.
musculoskeletal,"Are you able to raise your legs when in a lying position with straight legs, knees not bending at all, they are able to raise without any pain?","No, I can't do that. It's yeah, it's too painful."
musculoskeletal,"I see, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you so it seems. It's great, it's good that you came to the emergency Department. Do you have any questions at all?","No, just like how can I fix this?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?","No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help."
musculoskeletal,How can I help you?,"Hi, I just was brought in here today. I had a fall just waking up coming down the stairs. I fell off the last few stairs and just fell onto the right side and on, right onto my head and now, uh I couldn't even I could barely stand up and put any weight on my hip. It's the right hip."
musculoskeletal,"OK, Uhm, so what caused you to fall in the 1st place? Did you just lose balance, were you dizzy?","I think I just I missed, I wasn't dizzy or anything. I just missed one of the steps and just slipped, slipped down the stairs."
musculoskeletal,OK.,But it was just the last few stairs I didn't have like I didn't hit my head or anything like that.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and when was this?",This was a so I guess now two hours ago.
musculoskeletal,"Two hours ago, OK. Has a pain been constant since?","Yeah, it's, it's really excruciating."
musculoskeletal,"OK, does anything make it better or worse?","No, it's I'm just in extreme pain. Like I I I can't even put any weight on it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so you can't, OK so you can't weight bear, and you can't walk on on that leg I guess.",Mhmm.
musculoskeletal,OK. Is it a sharp kind of pain or is it dull and achy?,"It's uh, it's pretty sharp, like if I'm not putting any weight on it right now, it's like really achy. But if I put any weight on, it's really sharp."
musculoskeletal,OK. And where is this pain exactly? Is it just in your right hip or is it radiating up into your upper anterior lower back or down to your leg?,"It's in the right hip, mostly just on the side, but the pain is kind of like, all over the right side of my groin and I feel like there's some swelling there as well."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And one to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever. How bad is your pain?","I would say 10, like I've never experienced pain like this."
musculoskeletal,"10, OK. And do you, have you ever had pain like this before? Like have you ever had a fall in the past?","No, this isn't this is the first time I've had a fall."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any numbness or tingling?","Uhm, no, not that I can tell, no."
musculoskeletal,Dizziness or fainting spells?,"Uhm, after the fall out like this, I I don't know if it's due to the pain, but even in the ambulance, coming out of the ambulance I was feeling a little bit dizzy, but I don't know if that's just 'cause of the pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any headaches?",No.

musculoskeletal,Any cancers?,"Uh, I think, my, my mother had some skin cancer, but the ones that, she didn't need any surgery, they just zapped them off."
musculoskeletal,OK. Uhm and do you smoke?,"No, I've never smoked?"
musculoskeletal,"OK, uhm, do you drink alcohol?","Just maybe like a wine, what every other day, a glass of of wine."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and then do you consume marijuana in any form?",No.
musculoskeletal,OK. And how about in terms of where you live? Who do you live with and where do you live?,"I live with uhm, just my husband and and we just live in a small apartment."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And have you been in touch with any, anyone sick recently?","Uh. No, I've I've been like at home with my husband. We haven't really left."
musculoskeletal,OK. And have you done any travel recently?,"Uhm, no, I've just stayed at home."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. So if you can, I'm going to get you to take a look at both your hips as well as your legs. Do you notice any redness or swelling in the area?",I do notice some swelling. It's a little bit red. I can't really see too much red.
musculoskeletal,OK. OK. Any muscle atrophy? Any deformities or skin changes like bruises?,"Uh, maybe some bruising, but I, I don't notice anything else."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright. And then when you place the back of your hand on both hips, do you notice any temperature changes? Is one side warmer than the other?","It's a little bit warmer, the right side than the left."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and does one like appear to be shorter? Or does does it appear to be misaligned? Or in any sort of like strange positions like outward turning of your leg, one compared to the other?","I think it's a bit, but look at it a bit, like outward turning. And then yeah, I would say it's more outward turns."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and if are you sitting down right now?","Uh, yeah."
musculoskeletal,"OK, are you able to stand up from a sitting position?","I can try, but it's very painful."
musculoskeletal,OK.,"Yes, should I go ahead and try?"
musculoskeletal,Yes please.,"Yeah. So I yeah I can barely stand up. I can't, it's kind of just, I'm just supporting myself with my left like."
musculoskeletal,"OK and so I, I guess you can't do any of the like hip flexion or hip extension, hip abduction or addduction, correct?","No, I can barely move it."
musculoskeletal,OK alright those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?,"No, I think I I just don't know if I need surgery or something."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so it sounds like you have a hip fracture from your fall. Uhm, so, the way to treat this is a combination of surgeries and rehab and medication. So we will definitely look into the surgical option first, which is done using some internal repair with screws. Or, you can do a total hip replacement or a partial hip replacement. The orthopaedic surgeon will uh, decide like which option is best for you after we refer you for a consult with them, and then after that surgery they'll likely refer you to some rehab, so physiotherapy will focus on improving your range of motion and strengthening the muscles in that area. Uhm, and for management of pain, you can take ibuprofen or any over the counter pain medications for now. Does that sound OK?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"I've just been having uh, this pain in my um right, right elbow, and it's just been getting worse over the last few days. I started having it around three days ago. Um, and it's just been getting worse with any kind of gripping motion or, yeah, so it's, it's been getting worse."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, so you said it started three days ago. Um, has it been persistent since, or has it been like on and off?","It's been pretty persistent, um, but it's mainly when I'm uh, doing some activities or lifting anything. Um, and yes, I've just been trying to rest it mostly."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, okay, that's good. And um, you said it's worse with activity and better with rest. Have you tried anything else for it?","Um, I've tried some Advil, it, it seemed to help a little bit, but uh, it just comes back."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, um, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's sharp, burning, throbbing, achy?","It's more um, like if I don't extend my wrist, it's kind of like achy, but then if I extend my wrist, I feel like a sharp pain at um, on the um, just on the outside of my elbow."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, alright. Um alright, and then um, in terms of severity, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how bad is the pain?","Um, probably like a 6 or 7."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Alright, um, and have you ever experienced this type of pain before?","No, I, I, I've never experienced any kind of pain there at least."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Um, how about um, in terms of like timeline, is it getting worse?","Um, just over the past three days, I feel like it's, I have tried not to use it that much. Uh, like when I was at work, I have to use like tools a lot um, and I noticed that when I was using a screwdriver, like it, it hurt a lot. So it hasn't been getting worse, but if I try to do anything at work, it definitely hurts a lot more."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, um, alright. And then have you noticed any numbness or tingling?","Um, no, no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"No, okay. How about um, pain elsewhere on your body?","Sorry, what was that?"
musculoskeletal,Pain elsewhere on your body?,"Oh no, no pain elsewhere."

musculoskeletal,Changes in your voiding?,No.
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?","Yeah no, I've been healthy, uh, no other issues in my Life."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, that's good. Um, how about, um, medications, are you on any?","No, no medications. I've just been taking some Advil for this pain."

musculoskeletal,"Okay. Um, any concerns for STIs?",No.
musculoskeletal,Any sick contacts recently?,No.
musculoskeletal,Have you traveled anywhere recently?,No.
musculoskeletal,"Okay, well um, let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview then. Um, so I'm going to get you to look at both your uh, arms and hands and you let me know if you see any redness or swelling in uh, your right arm compared to your left.","Okay. Um, so like, with movement?"
musculoskeletal,"Uh no, uh, just on inspection, do you see any redness or swelling?","Um, no, I don't really see anything that's too different, no."
musculoskeletal,"No, okay. Uh, do you see any deformities, atrophy, or skin changes in your right compared to your left arm or hand?","No, they look pretty similar to me."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Alright, and then I'm gonna get you to press down on certain areas of your right arm. So you can start with the back of your elbow. Does that hurt?","Uh, just like right on the elbow, it doesn't hurt, but when I go on the outside part, it does hurt on the back."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, so like the lateral aspect of your elbow?","Yeah, it's like sore if I press down."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about the medial aspect of your elbow?","Um, so yeah, on the inside, not so much. Maybe a little bit, not, not that much."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, how about when you press down on your biceps or triceps?","Uh, nothing."
musculoskeletal,"Nothing. How about when you um, press down on your like, forearm extensor muscle group?","Um, just, yeah, so just on the outside of my forearm, close to where the elbow pain is, if I go down a little bit and press down, it does definitely feel sore."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and then how about with your forearm uh, flexor, flexors.","So on the inside, um, not so much, no."
musculoskeletal,"No, okay. And now I'm gonna get you to walk through some movements with me. Um, can you uh, get a piece of paper and, actually can you get a pencil and grip it as tight as you can. Um, do you find that you feel weak when you do that?","Um, not weak, but it does definitely like um, when I picked up the pencil and moved my wrist up, it did, it did uh, cause some, some pain."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, alright. So would you mind extending or like straightening out your elbow all the way and then also straightening out your wrists. Um, does that hurt?","Uh, straightening out, no, it doesn't hurt."
musculoskeletal,"Even with uh, like the wrist um, straightened out?","Um, yeah if I, if I completely straighten out my wrist uh, then like I just feel a bit of uh, soreness, but not as much pain as when I, um, am lifting something with my wrist or just raising my wrist upwards."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Okay, how about when you flex your wrist all the way?","Um, that hurts a little bit, but not nearly as much as when I extend it."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Okay, um, those are all the questions I had for you today, and did you have any questions of your own for myself?","Uh, yeah, I was just wondering what this, this might be."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so um, it sounds like you have something called tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis. Um, and it's usually related to some overuse, um, injury, so whether at work, or if you play a lot of tennis or some sort of sport, that um, overuses a certain muscle group, um, particularly like the forearm extensors. Um, and so basically for this, um, we suggest a few things. We'll start with like some conservative management, like activity modification. So at work, if you're doing repetitive movements, maybe not do them so much and take frequent breaks, you can try some like ibuprofen, we'll refer you to some um, physiotherapy to help build those muscles around that, that area. And if those still do, don't work, um, we can try some um, other things like operative um, operative management, but we'll, we'll come back to that in about 6 to 12 months, um, once we uh, we try all of the other stuff. Does that sound okay?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,I'm so I was skiing yesterday and I fell on my arm and now and it's it's my hands very painful and it looks swollen and bruised. So I thought I should come in and get it checked out.
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly alright and so you fell while while you're skiing, so did you use your hand to brace the fall, like with your hand kind of with your wrist extended backwards?","Yea. Yeah, so I kind of yeah had my arm stretched out and I fell right on it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and did you feel pain right away?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"OK, um, and during the fall did you injure any other parts of your body like your elbow or shoulder or even your head?","No, I don't think so. I didn't have, I don't have any pain anywhere else."
musculoskeletal,OK. Uhm and like are you able to move your wrist currently?,"I can, but it's very painful."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and so when did this happen, was it yesterday?","Ah yes, it was yesterday."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how would you describe the pain, is it's a sharp pain, dull pain, achy?",It's pretty sharp.
musculoskeletal,"Sharp, OK and are you feeling the pain radiate anywhere else like down into your hand or up into your arm?","Uhm no it's pretty local the pain. Yeah, it's pretty, it's right below the thumb area and just kind of on my wrist an on the right side."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Is there anything you've done that's made it that made it better? Like, have you tried any medications or any ice or topical creams?",I've been taking ibuprofen for the pain and try not to move it too much and that's been helping a little bit.
musculoskeletal,OK. And is the pain constant or intermittent?,It's constant.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And, have you done anything that's that's made the pain worse?","Um, I guess moving it."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And what is the severity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt?",I give it like a five or six.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and if you touch the joints around the wrist on both sides, is the right wrist, does it feel hot?","No, actually. Yes it does."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and are you noticing any muscle atrophy or or any deformity at the wrist?","Uh, I guess there's like a slight bruise."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and are there any like raised bumps if you put your finger over it over the bony edges?",Uhm no bumps but just a general kind of swelling in the area that makes it look raised.
musculoskeletal,"Alright, and and if you palpate or press on some areas of the wrist are there any areas that you're feeling pain like at the distal radial head, the distal ulna, uh or any areas of the wrist?",Uhm there's some pain at the distal radius for sure.
musculoskeletal,"OK, uh, alright and is this on the back of the hand or the that the palm side.",It's on the palm side.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Do you feel any pain if you push in the what's called the anatomical stuff box, so it's at the base of the thumb um on yeah, the base of the thumb on the back of your hand?","Base of the thumb, um no, I don't feel any pain there."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And. OK, so no pain at the the dorsal anatomical snuffbox and in terms of range of motion are you able to flex and extend your wrist?",I am.
musculoskeletal,"OK and then how about move it like side to side, kind of deviating it?","Uhm I can do all of these things, it just hurts a lot."
musculoskeletal,"OK, are you able to make a fist?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"Alright, and do you have any problems at the elbow or are you able to flex and extend the elbow OK?",I can flex and extend OK.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so I think that was everything that I wanted to check today. Did you have any questions or concerns?","Uhm no, just do I need any sort of surgery for this, and do I need an X Ray? How do I go about trying to treat this?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so I think I it, X-Ray would be the first step here because from what you're describing, and particularly with the mechanism of the injury and where you're feeling pain can be a common cause of a distal radial radial fracture which is one of the forearm bones. And so yeah, we will need an X-Ray to look to see if there is a distal radial fracture. And it's not sounding like this right now, but another thing that will look for on on the X Ray of the hands too is a scaphoid fracture to make sure that that's OK, but you didn't have any pain in the area of the scaphoid, which is reassuring, but we still want to image and make sure, although that most likely thing would be the distal radial fracture an if that's the case, then there will be like we will have to go into a cast for a period of time. And depending on how much joint involvement there is, there might be the possibility of surgery, but cannot comment too much on on that just yet. We will need to get the imaging first.","OK, OK, that sounds good. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,What can I do for you?,"Hi there, yeah I've had this pain in my knee that's been going on for a few weeks now and it hasn't gone away and and so I thought I would get checked out. It's been really impacting my running. I just haven't been able to run as often as I would like to and so that's why I wanted to get this looked at."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, for sure. You said it started a couple of weeks ago. Was that two weeks ago, three weeks ago? Or more than that?","Yeah, I would say maybe it's been going on for the past four weeks, for the past month."
musculoskeletal,Past month. OK. And is it a constant type of pain or does it come and go?,"It comes and goes, yeah, and it depends on what I'm doing."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uhm, alright and what kind of makes it worse or better?","So if I'm out while running, what will bug it, but I think like that the main things that hurt are if I'm walking down stairs or if if I'm squatting. I like to lift weights as well, and yeah, I could barely even do body weight now 'cause if I I'm squatting down it causes a lot of pain, it's a sharp pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your pain, would you say it's achy, throbbing, dull, sharp, burning?","Uh, it's a sharp pain."
musculoskeletal,"Sharp pain, OK. And one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had. How bad is this pain?",It's about a 7.

musculoskeletal,"Right underneath the knee, OK.",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,OK. Alright and otherwise like have you had any weight loss?,"No, my way it's been the same."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about fevers or chills?",No fevers or chills.
musculoskeletal,OK. How about fatigue?,"No fatigue, energy's been good."

I have a daily, a daily one that I'll use and then, just a, like rescue one. So like the blue one that I'll use sometimes, but I haven't needed that one for for awhile. I've been pretty good. I don't even need it when I'm going or runs anymore."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK that's good. And are you on any medications?","Yeah, just the just the inhalers and then I took uh, birth control as well. I've been taking that since I was 16 so, yeah, so for like 6 years? 7 years?"

musculoskeletal,OK. And any autoimmune conditions?,"No, I don't believe so."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. How about cancers?","Uh, no, no cancers in the family."
musculoskeletal,"OK, And, and do you smoke?","No, I I try to stay away from that with all the running and stuff that I'm doing. I'm uh, I want to make sure that I'm able to to improve."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, for sure. And how about marijuana? Do you consume that in any form?","No, I don't."

musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, and travel anywhere?","No, we've been at, been at home."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, uhm, alright, so I think those are all the questions that I have for you. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview, if that's OK with you. So I'm going to get you to take a look at both your knees and let me know if you see more redness or swelling in your left knee compared to your right.","Uh, no, I'm not noticing any swelling."
musculoskeletal,Do you see any redness?,"No, no redness."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. How about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes in your left knee compared to your right knee?","No, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. I'm gonna get you to press down and palpate on your quadriceps on both knee. Sorry, on both thighs. Do you feel any pain there?","Uh, no pain there."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about when you press down on your knee caps?","Yeah, I do get some pain when I push on the on the kneecap, uhm, on my left knee."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about just below that where your shins start?",No pain there.
musculoskeletal,"No pain there, and then how about on the lateral aspects of your knee?","Ah, no pain there."
musculoskeletal,And then the medial aspects of your knee?,No pain there.
musculoskeletal,"No pain there. OK, good. When you are palpating, was there a difference in temperature between the left and right knee? Was the left knee a little bit more warm than the right knee?","No, the temperature feels the same."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, good. So now I'm going to uhm, are you sitting down?",I am yes.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so from a sitting position I'm going to get you to stand up uhm, and you let me know if that is painful.","It is, yeah."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, OK. Uhm, and then how about when you bend your knees?","Uhm, no, no pain with just bending."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about when you, uh, when you flex your hips so you can do one leg at a time, does that hurt?","Oh no, that doesn't hurt."
musculoskeletal,OK. And how about squatting down?,"That does hurt. Yeah, squatting hurts."
musculoskeletal,Squatting hurts OK. OK and then how about when you point your toes towards the ceiling?,No pain.
musculoskeletal,OK. How about when you point your toes towards the ground?,No pain.
musculoskeletal,"No pain. So no pain on dorsiflexion or planter flexion, OK. Do you hear any like popping or crackling sounds in your knees when you climb stairs or when you're standing up after sitting down for a long time?","Yeah, yeah, sometimes I will hear, uhm, some, some like yeah, crackling sounds."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright and yeah, you mentioned that you do a lot of running. Do you do any other sorts of exercises?","Yeah, I'll do some weight lifting and like cycling as well. I mean, all kinds of different stuff. We just, like staying as active as I can."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright yeah, given your young age and the fact that you do a lot of running and a lot of physical activity like cycling and lifting weights, what you have is most likely something called a Patellofemoral syndrome and that is basically a nerve. Uh kind of pain and then in the in the soft tissues and bone around your kneecap. Uhm, and it's basically happens because of overuse, so vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, uhm, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. Uhm, we can do a few things that that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running that would be good. So, in the meantime, while you while you switch to like low impact activities, whether that's like riding a stationary bike or swimming, you can also try something called the RICE method and so that stands for resting, uhm, so avoiding putting any strain on that knee using ice packs for several days, compression, so wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, then the level of your chest can help. And then with the sharp pain you could also also take ibuprofen for pain management. Uhm, yeah, so we can start there if it doesn't get better we can also order an x-ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those nonsurgical treatments work, oh sorry, I also forgot to mention will also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strength and endurance. But of those non surgical treatments work we'll also refer you to like am arthroscopy or some sort of surgery that may be able to fix the issue more permanently. Does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, thank you."
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"So I've just been having this pain in my knee since I um just fell, uh, just three days ago slipping on the stairs. Since then I've been having a lot of pain."
musculoskeletal,I see uh so did this pain start right after like falling on the stairs?,"Yeah, yeah, I've been having the pain since then."
musculoskeletal,OK.,And that was three days ago.
musculoskeletal,"Three days ago, OK. And you're feeling the pain in your in your right knee?","Yeah, in my right knee."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uh. And what would you say the character of the pain is, or how would you describe the pain?",It's kind of like a dull aching pain.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And has the pain been getting um, any better or any worse?","Uhm, it's kind of getting worse actually just in my right knee as well as my whole right calf as well."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. Uh. What is the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt?",Probably around 6.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um. And. Did your knee hurt before this at all, or did you have any trauma to the leg before?","No, no before 3 days ago before my slip I was fine."
musculoskeletal,"OK, are you feeling the pain anywhere else besides your right knee?",In my calf I'm getting a lot of pain as well. In my right calf.
musculoskeletal,"OK, has there been anything that's made the pain worse?","Yeah, if I am If I'm walking or if I'm moving that leg and putting weight on it, it's definitely worse, so it's definitely like better if I just stay seated and stay resting."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Is there anything she said resting that helps, is there anything else that's helped?","I did take some Advil which did help for a few hours, but then it just kind of went back to the same."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uhm. And. Yeah, have you had any other, uh, like associated symptoms with the right knee and calf pain?","Yes, I also think there's some swelling in my right calf as well. Since yesterday."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, there's some swelling there.",Mmm

Things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it, there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be like injuries to some of that, the ligaments there as well. And however, with this the swelling immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive Homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies, get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an X Ray of the right knee to to start OK.",OK sounds good. Thank you so much.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and any sensory changes to the skin?","No, no."
musculoskeletal,OK and reflexes are normal.,Mmmm
musculoskeletal,OK. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?,"Ah no, that was it. Just what can I do about my my knee?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x-ray if things aren't improving.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"I've just come in today because I've been having some issues with my hips as well as my knees.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and you said it started in the past month?","Yeah, maybe up to two months actually. Yeah, I would say two months."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and is the pain and stiffness always there or does it come and go?","It's, it comes and goes. It's worse in the, so it's stiff, more stiff in the morning first, but like as the day goes on, probably near the afternoon it gets worse. So I've had to stop some of my activities like gardening and being outdoors and things like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And you said it's, it gets worse with activity. Is there anything else that makes it better or worse?","Uhm, it probably, yeah, if I'm just exerting myself too much. Uh, in terms of better, I I think I've taken some Advil that does help with the pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. And then if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's achy, throbbing, dull, or sharp?","It's kind of like this uh, achy pain, kind of deep within the joints themselves."
musculoskeletal,OK.,"Yeah, it just gets worse. I, as I walk more and do more activities."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and does the pain radiate also or does it, or is it pretty localized to your hips and knees?",It's mainly in those areas.

musculoskeletal,"No, OK. How about any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. And then how about on your knees? Do you see any redness or swelling there?","Not really, no."
musculoskeletal,"No. Any atrophy, deformity, or skin changes there?","Uh, no."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. I'm gonna get you to palpate your hipbones. Does that hurt?","No, not really."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about when you do that to your knees?","Uh, the knee I can feel a little bit of I would say it's more of a discomfort then tenderness."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so some discomfort on the patella palpation. Uhm, alright and then when you palpate those areas, do you feel like there is a grading sensation? How, does it feel warm?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. And then I'm gonna get you to, can you flex your hips all the way so bend so from a sitting position stand up first? Does it hurt when you extend your hips like that?","Not right now. I think, I'm pretty sure my hips are pretty well rested right now, but there is still a little bit of stiffness."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, so some stiffness on hip extension. How about when you bend your hips all the way?","Yeah, that's a I can't really go down that far. But yeah, even bending, as much as I can, there is some discomfort there."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so some discomfort and some pain on hip flexion as well as limited range of motion.",Mhmm.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, and when you do both of those, do you hear any like what's called a crepitus or like a grating sensation where you feel like bone maybe hitting bone?","No, not really."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. Alright, and I'm going to get you to, uh, extend your knee, so straighten it out. Yeah, does that hurt?","Uhm, yeah, a little stiffness in my knees. I feel like I feel more of the grating sound in my knees."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. And then how about when you bend your knees all the way backwards? You can do one at a time.","Uh, yeah I, yeah I definitely feel some discomfort there as well."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, OK. Alright, and how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?","No, that's fine. I can do that."
musculoskeletal,And then how about when you point your toes to the ground?,Yeah no issues.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so no pain or limited range of motion with plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. OK, so those were all the test that I want to do with you today. Did you have any questions or concerns?","Uh, no, not really."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK, uhm, so it sounds like what you may have is something called arthritis, which basically happens, uhm, when the cushions at the ends of your bones and your joints kind of degenerate over the years, and so bone can eventually rub on bone, which causes like the grading sensation and causes the pain. Uhm, and it's it happens in old age, it happens with wear and tear so to diagnose it, we we'll, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an x-ray of your hips and knees which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis and basically for now we'll try to manage it conservatively so you can take and sets like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. We'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain. Uhm, and another thing that may be worth considering is occupational therapy because they can help you find ways to do everyday tasks without putting too much stress on an already painful joint. And if these things don't work in the future, we can also discuss things like steroid injections or joint replacement. Does that sound like a good plan?",": Yeah, that sounds great, thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"Yeah, I'm so I'm here with my mom because I am having this pain in my right hip and groin area. Um I was playing with my friends too.

musculoskeletal,"Alright, yeah, so anything that we talked about here today will stay confidential as long as there is no harm to yourself or others or risk of harm to yourself or others. So yeah, I'm just going to ask you a few questions pertaining to your health.","Sure, that sounds good."

musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, alright, so yeah those were just some of the questions I had today we'll do a full physical examination and have you come in. Alright, sorry and like well will continue with the full examination today and what currently it seems like it can definitely be from the fall. You may have injured yourself and we just want to make sure there's no fractures like a hip fracture.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"One thing that's also something that we have to investigate is something called slipped capital femoral epiphysis. So this is, this is a common hip issue in adolescents, especially from boys aged 10 to 16. And usually it's the left hip that's affected, but it it can be the right. And as adolescents are in a phase where they were growing, there is, if they have some predisposed disposition too slipping of the capital femoral if epiphysis, which is right between your hips, you can get some slipping. It can be after a fall or it can happen just as the child is growing, and it can also it is also associated with the increasing weight that a child may have. So what we can do is just get first an X-Ray of both the hips.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"And see like what we can find on the X-Ray and then will also do a full examination. And it, if it does turn out that there is a fracture or there's a slipped capital femoral epiphysis we will need to send out a referral to pediatric orthopedic surgery.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so yeah, first we'll just get the image Ng done and see what's going on in there and then we'll get back to you shortly.","OK, that sounds great. Thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"I have been having this, pains in my in my joints that's been ongoing now for the last several months and it's been getting worse over this period of time."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so several months, is the pain, so where, where exactly is the pain?","So I get it in some of the joints in my hands. And then also my feet as well. So yeah my. Yeah, really in my feet and my hands."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and what kind of pain is it, is it like an aching pain, is it sharp pain?","It'll be a bit at achey when it's there, but I if I move the joints at all when it's really sore, I can get a sharp pain as well."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and is this pain worse at all at any particular time of the day?","Yeah, I would say in the morning time or if there's any period of time where I I'm like sitting and resting for awhile and I get up to move. I have a lot of stiffness and it takes me over an hour, sometimes to just get moving."

You get, do you get like morning you get morning stiffness and then when you're not very active or not doing things but then it gets better with movement?","Yeah, exactly, yeah there's morning stiffness and it does get a little bit better with with movement."
musculoskeletal,"OK, do you have any of this pain or stiffness in the bigger joints in your body, like the hips or the knees or your shoulders?","Uh, no nothing, no. Just really the small joints."
musculoskeletal,OK in the morning stiffness lasts more than 30 minutes you said?,"It does, yeah."
musculoskeletal,"Yes, OK. Is is it symmetrical like is the pain symmetrical as in is it happening in both hands in the same areas and both feet in the same areas?","Yeah it is actually now that you mentioned that, it is symmetrical. I'm noticing that it's the same. It's the same joints on both sides of my body that I'm seeing that are affected."
musculoskeletal,"OK now yeah, I I just have. Yeah, this one particular question. It's pretty specific, so when you look at your hands in which joints are painful. In your fingers is, do you, do you have any pain or swelling in the last joints like so just um, just, below the tip of your fingers?","No, actually like the those joints are all, have been fine. I can move the tips of my fingers no problem, and I haven't had any joint swelling or pain in the tips of my fingers."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how about, have you had any pain at all in the, I guess the first joints of the finger. So when you make a fist like the first joint that bends?","Oh yeah, like my knuckles, you mean?"
musculoskeletal,Yeah that your knuckles.,"Yeah, yeah those actually. Those are the worst I can notice, those kind of on the like on my index finger, middle finger and and ring finger on both sides they they all look like they're swollen and and those hurt hurt really bad."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and in your feet, which joints would you say are hurting the most?","I, I would say the like the big toe joint. On both of my feet, those bother me. Yeah, but my big my big toe on on both feet, but my right foot's worse than the other."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see OK. And are you getting any pain in any other joints?","Um actually yeah my my right ankle bugs me a little bit. I'm sorry if that's considered a large joint. But yeah, my ankle hurts and then also my in my hands I have. Like the middle one. Not proximal interphalangeal joint, yeah those ones hurt too."
musculoskeletal,OK.,I think I have like more than 10 joints that are swollen and painful.
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see and has this pain been pretty constant or have there been days that you don't have the pain?","Yeah, there are days that are better than others for sure. It just. I'm not really too sure what the reason it is like. Maybe I'm just more rested or something like that, but.

musculoskeletal,"OK. Are you feeling any other symptoms at all, like fevers or chills?",Um I do. I have felt a bit warm.

musculoskeletal,"OK. Um yeah, so those are just some of the questions I had for you now. I just wanted to ask a few questions regarding just physically examining the joints that hurt. So when you look at those joints, do you notice any kind of swelling, redness, or when you feel any warmth to them?","Yes I yeah I do. I feel swelling, warmth and redness."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you notice any kind of deformities, for example like you're not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you didn't see before? Or, like, for example, your wrist is turned uh, outwards a little bit. Anything like that?","Uh, no, nothing like that, no deformity."

musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?","Um no, I'm just wondering what what this could be."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so from what you're describing to me you do fit into. The age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis, and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis. Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well. So does that sound good?","It does, yeah, thank you."

musculoskeletal,OK. And are you right or left handed?,I'm right handed.
musculoskeletal,"OK yeah, and you mentioned it was the right hand that started to hurt first and then the left one has started since then?","Yeah, yeah, and I don't know if it's just 'cause I use my right hand more that I feel more pain and the symptoms. But yeah, I definitely would say it's worse."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and where are you finding that the pain is specifically located?","So the pain I feel like it's more like a discomfort. Just over the like palm, like near the wrist and the lower palm area is where the discomfort is and then the numbness and tingling is just like in thumb an the 1st 2 digits."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how would you describe the character of this sensation, is it burning, is it sharp, achy or or stabby?","Um I would say it's more of kind of like an aching, aching pain. Um it does sometimes turn into kind of like a burning sensation with the tingling, but yeah, more so on the palmer like on the palm side of things, it's more like an aching pain."
musculoskeletal,OK. And you have some burning as well?,Yeah.

musculoskeletal,"OK, um so kind of like flicking your wrist sort of thing, so kind of shake out the?",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"OK, um an anything that you do that makes it better besides those moves like have you taken any medications or tried any like wrist splints or anything like that?","No, I haven't tried any medications or splints."

musculoskeletal,"OK, and how about autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or like hypothyroidism or type one diabetes?",In my family history? I think there is.
musculoskeletal,Yeah.,"Some, there's definitely some diabetes on my father's side. But other than that, I think one of my aunts on my mother side had um a hysterectomy for cancer."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright and was it endometrial cancer?","Not sure actually, but she I just know that she had her uterus removed."
musculoskeletal,I see alright and um so next I wanted to just move to the physical exam portion and so just first inspecting the hand and wrist do you see any swelling or redness?,No.
musculoskeletal,"How about any changes to temperature, do any of the joints feel warm?",No.
musculoskeletal,And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of the joints in the hand?,"Uhm, maybe like just a little bit like I feel like I've lost some of like the fat pad just right near my thumb."
musculoskeletal,I see OK. And is there any areas of your hands over like any of the joints or over the rest that if you press you feel pain?,Um no.
musculoskeletal,OK and are you able to to move your wrist or the full range of motion?,"Yeah, I can move it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uh. And is there any, uh, so that then the next test I'll just ask you to just tap on the the kind of base of your palm there with your index finger and middle finger of your left hand, and when you do that, do you feel any burning or tingling?",Yeah yeah. I definitely do.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so that would be, yeah, positive Tinel sign and do you get any, so if you flex both of your wrists so that the back of your hands are pressing against each other. And if you hold that position, do you start to get symptoms of the burning and tingling?","Um yeah, I do feel it as well there."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright so that was everything I wanted to ask about and check today um did you have any questions?","No, I just wanted to know how I can fix this."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly so it's sounding like a carpal tunnel syndrome which that the differential would be something like radiculopathy coming up up from the neck, which you're not having any neck symptoms and the positive Tenel sign and positive Phalen sign are highly suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, along with the nighttime symptoms and the burning and tingling sensation you're experiencing. And so to help with this one of the first things that that can be done is trying to use like wrist splints at night to try to keep your hand in a neutral position, but also, uh depending on like if there is inflammation there NSAIDs might help a little bit like ibuprofen or or things like that. But the majority of the therapy will be kind of an activity modification, and if symptoms don't improve over a period of time, then surgery could be a potential option as well.","OK, sounds good."
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"Yeah I just came in here today I've been experiencing some difficulties with my right hand, especially at the bases of the 4th and 5th digits. I notice this happening over the last I'd say probably last few months it's been getting worse.

musculoskeletal,"OK. And you noticed um, and sorry, when exactly did it start?",Probably two months ago months ago.
musculoskeletal,"About two months ago, and it's the 4th and 5th digits or any other fingers involved or any parts other parts of your hand?","No, it's just those two."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uhm and how would you describe the the pain that you're feeling, is it a sharp pain and an achy pain or a burning pain?","Uhm, it's more a kind of like a aching, aching pain which gets worse with if I try to extend those fingers. And yeah, like that I do feel like the little nodules, but like pressing on them doesn't hurt or anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uh, and do you feel any radiation of pain like in into your hand or forearm?","Uhm, no, not really."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and alright, is there anything that is aggravating or making the pain worse?","Uhm I think just a extending, it's it's I would say more than the pain it's just like discomfort and just not being able to extend that is is frustrating, uh, like the pain isn't that bad like there's like minimal pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and is there any like like clicking or. Yeah any any clicking or catching when you're trying to like extend the finger?",Uhm I would say there is a. Yeah there's some like catching I would say if when I'm trying to extend.
musculoskeletal,OK. And has there been anything that that you've tried recently that's improved the discomfort or or helped with the range of motion?,"No, nothing that I've tried that has really helped and. Yeah, I'm just afraid if I stop kind of exercising and it'll just keep getting worse."
musculoskeletal,"OK, yeah, certainly. OK, and what, have you had any problems with your hand before like any trauma there or anything like that?","Uh, my my construction worker so there's always like a lot of. I haven't had any falls or injuries on my hands luckily, but there is always just constant lifting. There's I used to drill a lot too, so there's like always constant and I'm right handed as well.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and as anybody in the family had a Dupuytren's contracture before?","Uhm no, I haven't I haven't heard it now."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and so uh next, I just wanted to go on to the physical exam portion, so just a couple more questions. So when you're looking at your hand, are you seeing any swelling redness?","Not swelling, I just yeah just those nodules and I get like a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when I extend my fingers."
musculoskeletal,"OK yeah, but no redness?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and are you are you seeing any, uh like muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist?",Nope.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and uh are there any areas that that you can palpate over your hand that causes pain.","Yeah, there's just some discomfort, like when I at the bases of those two fingers, like if I press on the nodules like it's sometimes a little bit like uncomfortable but it's not too bad. Like I, I don't, but I don't know I have a pretty high pain threshold too, so it's hard to say."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see an when you're extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension?","Yeah definitely. I would say more painful than if I try to extend it myself. Like just forcing it back but yeah, but not not anything too like I like it's not sharp or anything like that."

musculoskeletal,OK. Uhm so I think that's everything that I wanted to ask about today. Did you have anything that you wanted to add or or did you have any questions?,"No, I think that's all."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture, but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger. Based on the the symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis.",Mmmm
musculoskeletal,"But it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that. But for Dupuytren's contracture. It'll be a uh, do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand.","OK, sounds good."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in here today?,"Hi, hi there I've been having this knee pain. It started almost immediately after I was I was playing basketball on the high school team and it was during practice I jumped up for a rebound and I, when I landed I heard a pop of my my left knee and I immediately felt pain. I just went off to the off to the sideline."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and when did this happen?","Uh, this happened about. Probably like 6 hours ago. Maybe like a few hours ago."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, I see and since then have you been able to walk at all or have you been just, has it been very difficult?","At first I was able to kind of limp off the court, but since then I I haven't really been able to walk. It's gotten pretty swollen since then and it looks bruised as well."
musculoskeletal,"OK, it's swollen and bruised in what kind of pain are you having, is it like sharp or is it aching?",It's pretty sharp. It feels like there's people just stabbing me in the knee.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uhm And um, do you have any, so you're having pain in your knee. Has it gone worse than when it started?","Um. Yeah, it's yeah it feels a bit more painful than it did earlier. I think maybe the adrenaline was pumping a little bit. But yeah, now it's it's pretty pretty painful."
musculoskeletal,"OK, are you having pain anywhere else or is it just your left knee?",Just my left knee.
musculoskeletal,"OK alright. Are you having other symptoms like fainting, dizziness?","No, I I haven't had anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and are you having any fevers, chills or anything like that?",No fevers or chills.
musculoskeletal,OK. Any kind of numbness or tingling at all?,No no Mr tingling.
musculoskeletal,OK. Is the pain moving anywhere else from your knees?,"Uh, no I just feel like pretty like just right in my in my knee."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and what kind of motions are hurting you right now the most?","I would say just like bending my knee, like, yeah, flexing my knee up as well as, like if I try to put any weight on it like I can't walk on it right now, I can't put any weight on my knee right now. And also even straightening it out hurts as well if I'm really flexing the muscle, so just trying to stay pretty immobile right now."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. OK, and in terms of other symptoms, any kind of chest pain, shortness of breath?","No, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any rashes or skin changes?","No, the only skin change that I that I have is the like bruising or looks like you like blood around my knee."

musculoskeletal,"OK, and any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions?","Um, no no, nothing like that I I I mean I think my dad I had a rotator cuff injury or something like that but I mean he's in his 50s now so I think that happened at work or something I don't know."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uhm, OK, and other than that, do you, so are you at school right now?","I am yeah, I'm in grade grade 10 and playing well playing on the the high school basketball team and that's how I got this injury here."
musculoskeletal,And have you had a similar injury at all in the past?,"No, I mean I'm I've I've sprained my ankles in the past, which would go would heal with some rest after a few days I never got those checked out because they're they weren't so bad, but I've never injured my knee before."
musculoskeletal,"OK and. Currently, right now, what's your living situation like?","So I live with both of my parents and I also have a younger sibling. A sister, she's 8 years old and we have a dog as well."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uhm. Alright, and have you experimented at all with any recreational drugs, alcohol, or smoking cigarettes?","No, nothing like that. I see kids at school um smoking and stuff, but, you know, as an athlete, I try to stay away from that kind of stuff as much as possible."
musculoskeletal,"OK, no, yeah, that's really that's really good that you're thinking like that. Any issues at school like bullying or do you feel unsafe either at home, around your home environment or at school?","No, I don't feel unsafe. I mean, I know there's always those kids at school who are mean to others. But I mean, I, I generally feel safe."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright so I'm just going to ask a few questions about just the examination part of part of this. Do you, so you mentioned you can't flex your knees at all, can you extend them?","Yeah it it can, uh, straighten it out all like most of the way, it seems like it's bent a little still maybe from like the swelling and only I can't straighten it out the full way."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and then you said you noticed like bruising and kind of like there's blood accumulating in that area?","Yeah exactly yeah, it looks like it. 'cause it's a bit like Brown. I guess I can like see or on my knee I guess like the like a big bruise."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. OK. And. Yeah, so those are kind of like all the questions I had for you. It seems that based on the description of how the injury happened an the mechanism and what you're feeling right now and in terms of the examination, it's possible that you had knee ligament injury. Most likely in this case, the anterior cruciate ligament, but just to make sure we will need to do an MRI of your knee and see which ligament is affected and to what extent. Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be. Just a surgery where we put kind of like a scope in into your knee and through the scope we try to fix the ligament. So yeah first, we'll just do the MRI and see to what extent your knee injury is and how how affected the ligaments are, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound OK?","It does. Yeah yeah, thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"I just had uh, well, it was just uh, I came from football practice I, uh, just felt like somebody fell on me while, like while I was on the ground and it's like, I've had this shoulder pain immediately afterwards and I can see a, like lump, um, kind of pointing out like in my skin here on my, on my, um, clavicle or shoulder bone."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, is it the right side or the left side?","Uh, it's the right side."

And so I've been just kind of holding my arm against my chest with my elbow flexed. I haven't really moved it at all."
musculoskeletal,"I see, okay. Um, and if you were to describe just what it looks like right now, does your shoulder kind of seem like it's sagging?",Yeah it does.
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and do you notice any point near your shoulder like clavicle area that has any bruising, swelling looks, like red? Anything like that?","Um, like maybe a little bit of bruising and swelling like over the area where I can see like my, my skin pointing up, but um, yeah, that's the only area."

musculoskeletal,"Okay, I see, that's good. Um, okay, and other than uh, so no medical conditions? Do you take any medications at all?","Um, yeah, I'll take like uh, just some allergy medication every once in a while. When it's like, just seasonal allergies, I think to just some environmental triggers is all."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and and do you have any allergies to any medications at all?","Uh, no, I don't believe so."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, anything that you've tried that has helped or made your pain worse?","No, I haven't, I haven't taken anything yet, I just uh, like basically came right from practice to the, to the hospital."

musculoskeletal,"Okay, alright, and um, do you work currently? Or are you a student?","Yeah, I'm in high school and, um, I, I work part-time at the grocery store as well, but uh, it's not that often though, because I've just been been playing sports, on the football team, we have a lot of practices and games and stuff."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. Um, do you drink alcohol?","Uh I, sometimes I, with friends. Um, we've had a couple of beers here and, here and there, but I mean it's, it's not something that I've done very often. Yeah, we've been pretty safe, I feel like."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and do you smoke cigarettes or marijuana, or use any recreational drugs?","No, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We'll do a full physical examination of the area. Um, we, we will definitely get an x-ray of the shoulder and clavicle to see what kind of, it seems like you have a clavicular fracture from just the mechanism of the injury, as well as everything you were describing. Um, but it is important to understand how, like what kind of clavicle injury it is and where it's affected, if it's in the middle area, on like the outer areas of the clavicle, um, and how much it's displaced because that will determine if we just need to reduce it here, and then give you a sling, and then you can go home. That's usually the case, but sometimes you may require surgery as well, and we would need to refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. So yeah, we'll, we'll get the x-ray done, and if you need anything for pain currently, we will give you some medications here, um and then we'll go from there.","Alright, thank you."
musculoskeletal,"You're welcome. Um, I'll be here with you shortly.",That sounds good. Thank you so much.
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"Um I'm here because I've had some numbness in my right hand and uh doesn't seem to be going going away, so I thought I should get it checked out by you."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly so, so when did this exactly start?","Um so it's been pretty gradual, I would say over the past month or two months um is when I first noticed it, but the numbness is definitely worse now than it was at the start."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and uh where is this um the pain and numbness, where are you feeling it exactly?","Um it's particular, it's the worst on my thumb and index finger."

musculoskeletal,"OK. Uh, and uh, like how long, is, are the symptoms constant or or are they intermittent?","Um I would say it's somewhat constant, but it's worse when um when I'm trying to like hold the steering wheel or using my phone, or you know, reading a book."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see, and um is there anything that you do uh at those times, to try to help get the symptoms to go away?","Um I guess I like shake out my hand um or yeah, try to put pressure on those numb, numb areas."
musculoskeletal,"OK, does flicking the the wrist or anything like that, does it help?",Uh maybe slightly.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And uh like how would you describe the the pains in your hand, like dull, achy, sharp?","I would say the pain is more like a tingling sensation. Um so I guess the tingling is is like a sharp feeling, um I wouldn't call it so much pain as I would just like tingling and numbness."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, and uh is is there anything, so you mentioned sort of the driving and using your phone, are there any other activities that make it worse?","Recently I found it's hard for me to hold things um in my right hand, so like if I'm trying to open up a jar um like it's hard for me to hold it, and sometimes I find uh like it'll just fall out of my hand."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so you're like dropping items and stuff?","Mhmm, yes."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you feel any, uh, like the numbness or tingling, does it radiate anywhere? Like to your forearm or up into your like upper arm or shoulder?","Uh no, I don't think so. No."

musculoskeletal,"OK, um but you don't have any other joint swelling or pains, right?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uh, and so next I would like to just um uh do a physical exam, and for the first part I'll ask you to just have a look at the hand and wrist and, are you seeing any swelling, erythema or redness or like any muscle wasting or or atrophy?","Um so, in my right hand, um I guess the you know the fleshy part of your thumb just above your wrist, um that seems to be um I guess atrophied compared to my left hand."
musculoskeletal,"OK so, OK, so the muscle bulk is um reduced there.",Mhmm.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and are you feeling any temperature changes, like does the, any areas of the hand or wrist feel warm or hot?",Um no.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and if you take your opposite hand, um with just your uh kind of pointer finger and middle finger and just really tap, um right near the wrist crease called the Tinel's test, you tap there. Do you feel any reproduction of symptoms?","Yeah, that that causes the tingling."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so you're positive Tinel's test, and um if you kind of place your wrist so that um like the backs of your hands are facing each other so that your wrists are flexed downwards and your um, your wrists are flexed and your fingers are pointing towards the ground and you just hold that position for a period of time. Um do you feel any pain?",Uh I guess a little bit of tingling.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so that would be a positive Phalen's test as well. Um and range of motion of the neck, do you have any problems with that or any pain there?",No.
musculoskeletal,OK. Um I think that was everything I wanted to ask about and check on the exam. Did you have any questions for me?,"Um no, no questions. Thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,"Alright, you're welcome, yeah, so it sounds like this could be uh carpal tunnel syndrome and uh so we we may depending on uh kind of like nerve studies to confirm the diagnosis, and um things that you can do in the meantime would be to use like a splint or um yeah, try to use like nighttime splints and activity modification as well.","OK, yeah, that sounds good."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"Um so I'm here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week um and any movement of that shoulder, of my right shoulder, causes a lot of pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how long have you been having uh this pain for?","For the past week,"
musculoskeletal,"Past week, OK. Um and did you injure your shoulder at all recently? Any trauma to the area or anything like that?","Um so about like, a couple of months ago, I um was do, I I work in construction so um I was moving around some heavy objects and um I guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury. But I had that um, like I got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months. But this pain just started a week ago."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and where is this pain located exactly?","Um it's it's just like in my shoulder, like at the joint between my upper arm and um shoulder."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and uh is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain?","So at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff, but um but when I move my shoulder, when I try to move it, it it causes more of a sharp pain."
musculoskeletal,"Sharp pain, OK and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain? Or is it just any movement?",Uh any movement.
musculoskeletal,OK. Are there any uh movements that are worse in particular?,"Um I think um, like no, anything hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, and how much would you rate this pain out, on a scale of zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?",I'd give it about a 7.
musculoskeletal,"Seven, OK.",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"And are you having uh, is this pain moving to any other uh joints or any other part of your body?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so just just in the area that you described?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you notice any kind of um, just looking at your shoulder outside, from the outside, any swelling, redness, any masses or deformities?","No, I don't see anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright and um is there anything that you've tried that has helped with your pain?","Um I've tried some ibuprofen, some ice. It seems to help temporarily."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury, did you get physiotherapy?","Um I did. But not, but I didn't finish the full course. I just went for a week or so and then um I had to go back to work, um so I stopped doing that."
musculoskeletal,"I see, um yeah, so that's something definitely uh it's very important and we'll need to consider going forward as well. Other than that, are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills?","Uh no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, any any weight loss um or loss of appetite? Anything like that?","Uh no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any numbness or tingling?",No.
musculoskeletal,Any weakness in your extremities?,No.
musculoskeletal,"Any um any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea, constipation, urinary changes? Anything else is going on?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. So it's mainly just the shoulder pain?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"OK, um alright, and does rest help at all, like when you're lying down, just not moving your shoulder. Does that help with your pain?","Uh, yeah I would say so."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And is is this stiffness there just throughout the day, or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day?",It's pretty much there all day.
musculoskeletal,OK. Alright um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?,"Uh, I have um, I have diabetes, but that's about it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you take any medications?",I'm on metformin.
musculoskeletal,OK. Um and do you have any allergies to any medications?,"No, no allergies to medications."
musculoskeletal,Have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?,No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. Um any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatological conditions?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and currently right now, so you said you work as a construction worker, right?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"And are you off of work right now, or have you been off work um due to your previous injury and pain, or are you still working?","I'm still working, but modified, um so I am not uh lifting any heavy objects or anything like that. I'm just doing some like groundwork."
musculoskeletal,"OK, that's good. Yeah, I mean, um we might also need to, if you're doing any kind of overhead like work where you're raising your arms above your shoulders, that might uh, cause further problems as well, so we'll look into some of those modified duties as well.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"Um yeah, and what is your living situation like right now? Who do you live with?",Um I live by myself right now.
musculoskeletal,Do you live in a house or apartment?,Um I live in an apartment.
musculoskeletal,"And, uh, uh, in terms of your daily life, do you smoke at all?","Um I don't smoke. I used to smoke before, but that was like 20 years ago."
musculoskeletal,"OK, that's good, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs?","Uh no, no."
musculoskeletal,"How about smoking, you smoke cigarettes? Sorry, you said you you quit. Um do you drink alcohol?",I'll drink like a glass of wine here and there.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, um yeah, and those were some of the questions I had for you. In terms of just a physical examination, uh when you press on the area that you describe, um when you press around the area, does it hurt?",I have to press pretty hard for it to hurt.
musculoskeletal,"OK, but otherwise it's not tender?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and again, no swelling, redness, or anything like that, just it's mainly just on the inside?",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and um and any kind of movement hurts, right? There's no particular movement that, like if you were instead of um trying to raise that shoulder by itself, if you were to just move it with the other arm. Does it hurt?",The other arm? The other arm doesn't hurt at all.
musculoskeletal,Or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm and shoulder. Does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself?,"It's, oh, it still hurts, any any moving of the shoulder hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright, so yeah, so based on what um you've told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury, what can sometimes happen is uh with those injuries, you might get some um inflammation and what might happen is something called uh adhesive capsulitis, or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder. And there's different stages, so that might happen, so in the initial stages like freezing um and then there's stiffening in stage two, and then usually after 6 to 12 months it starts uh getting better.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"Um and it might also affect your other shoulder as well. So what we'll um end up doing today is see if um we can get some um imaging done so we can do an X-Ray of your shoulder. I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"For some relief.  But yeah, so first we'll just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy, pain management, uh and then go from there. How does that sound?",That sounds pretty good. Thank you.
musculoskeletal,"Welcome, alright, so we'll call you for the X-Rays and then we'll go from there.","OK, sounds good."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"Um I'm here because my left hand, kind of just like at the base of my thumb, has been hurting for the past two days and it seems to be getting worse, um and I'm left handed so it's really hard for me to write or do anything um where I have to like, clench or grip things."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how long has this been going on for?","Uhm, so for the past two days, but it's got, it got bad yesterday."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and have you had any, uh if you were to describe the pain, where is it located exactly?",It's just at the base of my thumb. Uh you know where the fleshy part of your hand is?
musculoskeletal,OK yeah yeah.,"Yeah, so just just over there."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and what kind of pain is it? Is it sharp or is it aching?","Uhm, it's it's like a um, at baseline it's an achy pain, but if I try to move it or um try to write or you know, use a computer or anything like that, it becomes sharp."
musculoskeletal,"OK, Um and on a scale of uh zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've felt in your life, how much would you rate it?",I'd say like a 6.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and does this pain move anywhere else in your hand, or does it just stay where you described?",Um it just stays there.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and what kind of motions uh cause the most pain?","I'd say like um you know, trying to touch my pinky with my thumb, that that hurts. Um just like trying to rotate it hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, um have you tried anything for the pain that has helped?","Uhm, no, I haven't really tried too much. I've just I just tried not to use it as much."
musculoskeletal,"I see. OK. And um, has this ever like, have you ever had any injuries to this hand? Any trauma either recently or in the past?","No, no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, and is there any, do you do any kind of repetitive work that requires gripping or lifting um with that hand, anything repetitive?","So I do a lot of work at the computer. And um I guess I tend to type a lot with my left hand, so maybe that."
musculoskeletal,OK.,"And sorry I also take lots of notes, like handwritten notes with my left hand."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so are you left handed?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,OK. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?,No.
musculoskeletal,"No, so you're healthy?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,Um do you take any medications on a regular basis?,"Uh no, no."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. Any allergies to any medications?",Um no allergies.
musculoskeletal,"OK, um any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, any family history of any medical conditions, whether it's musculoskeletal, rheumatological, any conditions?","Uh no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, um any cancers in the family?","Um I know there's, yeah there's a lot of cancer in the family. There's colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer."
musculoskeletal,OK. And are they first degree relatives who had those cancers?,"Uh no first degree relatives, just like aunts and uncles."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Uh alright, and currently are you working right now or have you had any time off work or any modified duties?","Um so I'm still working online, I've just um haven't been taking notes by hand anymore."
musculoskeletal,"I see, and does that help though?",Uh yeah it it has helped a little bit because I'm not moving my hand as much so it helps with the pain.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Have you taken any uh Tylenol, Advil, anything for the pain?","No, I haven't."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright. And currently right now, what is your living situation like?",Uh I live in an apartment by myself.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and um, do you currently uh smoke cigarettes?","Um I smoke, I used to smoke like five years ago, and I only did that for like a year or two, um and it wasn't very much. But I don't smoke anymore."
musculoskeletal,"OK, that's good. Um any alcohol?",Um I'll have like a beer on the weekend.
musculoskeletal,OK. Any recreational drugs like marijuana?,Um I will take an edible like once a month.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um and yeah, those were just some of the questions I had um and we're just going to do a few things for examining, examining uh that area. So are you able to make a fist?","Um I can, but it hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, it hurts in that location that you mentioned?",Yes.
musculoskeletal,"How about um if you make a fist without your thumb, does it still hurt or is it just when you are moving the thumb?",It's just when I'm moving the thumb.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And if you were able to, are you able to uh rotate your wrist?","Uh yes, I can rotate my wrist."
musculoskeletal,Does that hurt at all?,No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, um now I just want you to do this one test. It's called a Finkelstein test. OK so I want you to flex your thumb, press it up down against your palm.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"And then hold your hand, sorry.","No, go ahead."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, and then after you do that, um, bring your fingers above your thumb, so just cover your thumb.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"Kind of like a fist, but your thumb is on the inside of your fingers.",OK.
musculoskeletal,And then bring your uh arm out.,OK.
musculoskeletal,"And with your other hand, can you, from above push your wrist downwards? So your uh pinky finger is uh pointing to the pointing to the ground.","OK, yep."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, and did that hurt at all? Like when you, so this is just called ulnar deviation or your um of your wrist. Does that hurt at all?","Yes, that is very painful."
musculoskeletal,"That's very painful, OK. Alright, um and then you're also having pain with gripping and, OK, so those are kind of all the things I wanted to ask. Uh it seems that you may be having something called De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Um it's caused by some repetitive motions, uh it can be due to gripping. Sometimes it happens to new mothers who are lifting their children as well as daycare workers. It can also happen in other work environments, and so what we will first just need to do um is mainly to rule out something like osteoarthritis. You are fairly young um but if there was ever an injury in the past, it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area. So we just want to get an X-Ray. And other than that, the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"And a sling for your thumb that uh helps relieve some of these symptoms, uh restricts some of your movements, reduces some of the swelling, and if it does get really bad and it's affecting your work and conservative management with pain and the splint don't work, and with physiotherapy, we do uh offer injecting corticosteroids into just right like in the area that you mentioned, right below the thumb.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"Um and that often has some effect as well. Um but at first, yeah, let's just do some conservative management and see if that helps. It's only been a few days, so hopefully um what we try first helps. And then we can go on from there.","OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,"Welcome, take care.",You too.
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"Uh, I, I'm uh, just coming into the clinic uh, today uh, my parents told me to come today. I don't know what this thing is, just mass right below, or kind of like a lump or mass below my right knee and it's not painful or anything, it's a little bit uncomfortable but I just want to check out and see what it might be."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly. Okay, when, when did you first um, notice this mass?","So I think I noticed it um, for the first time um probably a couple weeks ago. I would say like, two weeks ago I, I noticed it."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and uh, where specifically is it, is it located?","So it's, it's uh, below my knee uh, right on like uh, I feel it on the big big bone right below the knee. It's um, yeah, I just feel like uh, like a hard lump."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and uh, okay Um, and uh, is it, is it associated with any pain?","No, it's not really, uh, that painful. It's uh, it's, if I press on it, it's a little bit uncomfortable, but it's not like, I wouldn't call it pain."
musculoskeletal,"Okay. And have you had any trauma to the, to the knee, or area, or any injuries there?","Uh, no, not that I can remember. I don't think I've had any injuries there, and this lump is like, probably like 2 to 3 centimetres, it's, I don't even know like, when it appeared or why it appeared. I haven't really injured myself or anything."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, um, and have you had any, uh, any fevers or chills?",No.
musculoskeletal,"Okay, have you had any unexpected weight loss?","Uh, no, not that I can remember."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, uh, and how about, um, any neurological symptoms like numbness, tingling, sensory loss?","No, I haven't felt any of those."
musculoskeletal,"Okay, and how about uh, any muscle weakness in the lower extremity or upper extremity?","No, no weakness."

It's uh, it's when there's like an infection that um, can go into your joints and uh, it is a pretty serious issue that we need to um, assess and treat as soon as possible. So the first thing that we will um, need to do, we'll need to do some blood work just to get some inflammation markers and just your uh, CBC, and see if you have um, an infection. However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have. We will start you on antibiotics right away um, today, and so you will be um, here for a while until we get all those results back.

musculoskeletal,"Yeah, for sure it's so right now with having a like a red, warm and swollen joint that that's extremely tender and has limited range of motion. It's important to rule out a septic arthritis, however. Based on several of the risk factors such as diabetes, and obesity, as well as your family history of arthritis and gout. Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.","OK, that sounds great. Thank you."

Um and yeah, and if there is then it will be important to have some sort of air boot or casting so that to make sure that we're offloading the area for the bones to heal, but we'll see what the X-Ray shows.","OK, that sounds great, thank you."

I wouldn't recommend ibuprofen or NSAIDs on a long term basis, although you could take those if you're having like an acute flare up of your pain. Um and then also like topical agents such as um like Voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and um if it's really bad and it keeps um continuing on, we can consider something like a steroid injection as well.","OK, yeah, that sounds good.

musculoskeletal,OK. Would you mind standing up from a sitting position?,"Yeah, for sure."
musculoskeletal,Does that hurt?,"It uh yeah, that that that causes pain."

musculoskeletal,"OK and no pain on hip adduction. OK, well those are all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions for myself?",Uh just wondering about possibly like what it could be.
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, um so it sounds um right now like you may have some sort of uh sacral nerve radiculopathy um or or like a lower lumbar, lumbar um radiculopathy, um basically uh that's known as sciatica, uh where your nerve roots can be compressed, causing some of these symptoms. Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you."

musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI.",OK
musculoskeletal,"And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there.","OK, sounds good. Thank you."

musculoskeletal,"OK. And. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask and and check today. Did you have any questions?",Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?
musculoskeletal,"So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well.",Mmmm
musculoskeletal,"Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.","OK OK, thank you."

musculoskeletal,OK. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere?,"No, no, no numbness or tingling."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention?","No, that was that. What do you think I have and how can I fix it?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so it. It's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification, so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain. And using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well. And also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury. Um or yeah, or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there.","OK, that sounds great. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"Uh I just came in today I think I broke my leg or something, it's something that was, I heard a snap, I was in um just a dance class um and we have like these long uh dresses, it it was a traditional dance class and my foot uh slipped right onto, it got caught in my dress and it just kind of slipped and I I felt right on my, my leg kind of twisted and I fell down and I just stayed down.

musculoskeletal,"OK, so in the shin area, OK. Um have you tried anything for it? I know it's only been an hour.",Uh no nothing. I just like I just want to make sure I keep it as still as possible um I didn't wanna even try anything.
musculoskeletal,"OK yeah, that makes sense, if you were to describe this pain, would you say it's um sharp, dull, achy throbbing?",It's like sharp and throbbing. It's like probably one of the worst pains that I've felt in my life.

musculoskeletal,"Ten, OK, have you, so you said you've never experienced this before, um do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain, or has it been pretty much the same since it started, or is it getting better?","Uh I would say it's the same, it's like I'm in as much pain as I was earlier."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK and um so yeah, OK, um do you know how you felt like on the floor? Like did you uh go like leg first or was it, did your um, kind of like the mechanism of your fall, did you break the fall at all with your arms?","Uh no, I didn't break, it kind of, so I was kind of uh, I feel like when I was slipping it was at first my leg was hyper extended but it kind of just felt like it snapped and it went straight down, so there was some kind of twisting as well as some hyperextension. Um but it just kind of slipping on my dress and then just straight down."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. Um otherwise, do you have any pain elsewhere in your body?",No.
musculoskeletal,How about any numbness or tingling in the area?,"Um I do feel some numbness, tingling just below where it happened, um but it like comes and goes."
musculoskeletal,OK um and then how about how about any um like feelings of like losing sensation or feeling cold in that area?,"Um no, I I can feel everything in that area."

musculoskeletal,"In her fifties, OK.",Late fifties I would say.
musculoskeletal,"Um have you been, have you ever like been tested for that?","No, I've never, I've never had testing."
musculoskeletal,"OK, all right. Um and then any family history of lung or heart conditions?",No.

musculoskeletal,"OK, that sounds good, yeah we'll, we'll try our best.",Thank you.
musculoskeletal,"Um OK, so now looking at your legs like side by side, do you notice any uh redness or swelling in your right leg compared to your left?","Yeah, it's all, it's all swollen and red and just looks so much different than my other leg."
musculoskeletal,"OK, yeah, um do you notice any obvious like breaks in the skin?","No, there's no breaks in the skin but like when I fell like I, I can definitely see like the bend, there is like a bend in the bone, so I definitely do think it's broken."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you notice any like bony pieces that are pushing on the skin?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. Uh any bruises in the area?","Yeah, the whole area seems bruised up and angry."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um does uh, besides the bruising and the misalignment, do you notice any other obvious deformities, any muscle atrophy in the area?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK, and then uh placing your hand on one leg compared to the other, does it seem warmer?","Yeah, I feel like it's it's warmer."
musculoskeletal,"OK um and then I'm gonna try to get you to do some movements, um can you move your right leg at all, like can you flex and extend your knees?","No, not not at all like I I'm I'm too scared to try."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how about weight bearing, are you able to stand up at all on that leg?","No, I just I just got time to call the ambulance, I knew I knew it was just not possible."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright, um I guess those were all the questions that I had for you. Um I think you may have a tibial fracture. So we'll start with some X Rays um to be sure and to try to take a look at like where the fracture is and how we can approach that. Um because everything is swollen and angry down there, we'll probably try and um apply a splint um until the swelling goes down. And then um we can uh refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon for a surgic, for the surgery itself. So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion. Does that sound OK?","That sounds good. Alright, thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,What brings you here today?,"Yeah I had last night um so I'm having this pain in my right wrist. Yeah, but last night. I I tripped over something and I I ended up like landing on my hand to help break the fall and this morning I woke up and I have some like bruising on my hand and it's it's really sore to touch it."

musculoskeletal,"Oh, I see.

musculoskeletal,"OK, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. We definitely need to, since you're having pain on, just tell palpate palpating the area, there swelling redness, and you did have a fall and you landed on your you caught yourself with your hand. There is a common fracture that can happen in those circumstances to your wrist. And so we need to do an X-Ray and we will see if you have a fracture or not. But we also need to see if we need to get a cast for you or if if we can manage your injury with a splint or. And then based on what we see and if your physical examination we will determine how long you need to be in a cast or splint, and then we'll go from there.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."

musculoskeletal,"OK, does uh anything make it better or worse, the pain?","Um yeah, if I, really if I'm just resting the elbow um it makes it better, and I've tried uh things like ibuprofen um which has helped with the pain, I'll I'll do that for um hoping I can get through work sometimes if the pain is bad enough."
musculoskeletal,"Right, OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of the pain, is it sharp, throbby, achy?","Uh it's um kind of uh, well, it's achy and then sometimes depending on the movement it can get, it can be sharp as well."
musculoskeletal,"It can be sharp, OK. OK, um and what sorts of movements make it worse?","Um, so like, really it's mostly the movements at my wrist, if I'm bending my wrist down, uh I can I can feel it, or um if I'm having to pick things up or hold heavy objects at work, I do a lot of repetitive uh things at at work, I work on a line."

musculoskeletal,"OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?","Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?","Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings in here today?,"Hi there, I've just last night I was, I went for a run and I twisted my ankle. I think I stepped on something and it it really hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and so when did you have the injury?",It was just yesterday.
musculoskeletal,OK.,Yeah it was just just yesterday that it happened.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and do you remember if you twisted it so you twisted your ankle, like did did it twist inwards or outwards?","Inwards yeah, I feel like I inverted my ankle."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And, so since then, were you able to stand up and or were you not able to bear any weight?","No, I was able to, uh, kind of finish the I I I just finished the walk. I was able to walk home 'cause it didn't hurt that bad immediately. It was a bit painful, but the pain really started a few hours later and has been pretty much constant ever since."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK so it kind of got worse over time over the last day?",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"And do you notice any kind of bruising, redness, swelling, any skin changes?","No, I haven't really noticed I uh, really, any swelling or I or or skin changes. Yeah, no skin changes and no swelling."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how would you describe the pain? Is it like a dull, aching pain or sharp stabbing pain?",Dull and achy.
musculoskeletal,OK. OK. And has this happened to you in your ankle before?,"I'm I, I feel like I've maybe I I've done something like this when I was younger, maybe playing basketball or something like this when I was a kid, I twisted my ankle before."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and does this pain just stay, where's the pain exactly on the right side of your ankle or on your left, like interior side?",It's on the right kind of outside of the ankle.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and which ankle is this just to clarify?",On the right ankle.
musculoskeletal,OK so so it hurts on the right side of the right ankle.,"Yeah, exactly."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and does the pain radiate or move anywhere in your feet?","I can kind of feel it around on the the sole of my foot as well, but mostly on the outside though."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and is there anything that makes the pain better or worse?","Alright, it gets worse really to if if I move my ankle or if I'm standing on it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and anything that makes it better?","Alright, just if I rest and avoid moving it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, have you notice any fevers or chills?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, any pain in any other joints besides your ankle?","No, just my my right ankle."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any appetite or weight changes?","No, I've been I've been just training for this race coming up, so I mean I've been just trying to work on my fitness a little bit, but my weight has been relatively stable."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any weakness in your right right extremities or any kind of numbness or tingling sensation?",No numbness or tingling and no muscle weakness either.
musculoskeletal,"Ok, right. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?","I'm uh, I had diarrhea a few months ago and I was given a fluoroquinolone as an antibiotic."
musculoskeletal,"OK, that's two months ago. OK. And any medications that you're on currently?",I I take a Vitamin D and some other vitamins too. Vitamin A as well I guess that just helps my my skin and and then the vitamin D for my my bones.
musculoskeletal,"OK, any allergies to medications or any environmental issues?","No allergies, no."
musculoskeletal,"OK, any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Any family history of any musculoskeletal conditions, any rheumatological conditions. Anything that you know of?","My grandparents have arthritis, so and my like my dad had had gout before."

musculoskeletal,"OK, that's good. Any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that before?","No, I've never used anything like that in the past."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and how about alcohol?","Uh rarely I'll have maybe a glass of wine like once every couple of months, but it's pretty infrequent."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, so I just have a few questions. Right now over your right ankle, do you have, so you mentioned you don't have any swelling, but do you notice any kind of redness or warmth at all?","No, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and if you press down on your ankle, does it hurt a lot?","Uh a little bit of pain now that right, uh, like outside, but it's not uh, it doesn't hurt that bad. Yeah, I'll say no."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and if you kind of, uh, are you able to move your ankle at all?","I can, yeah I can move it around a little bit. I'm trying to avoid that though, just because it it does hurt, but I can move it around."
musculoskeletal,OK. And are you able to stand up and walk or are you not able to do that right now?,"I can, yeah, just for short periods of time 'cause it's just 'cause of the pain, but I can walk on it."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, yeah, so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done to make sure there is no fracture. Most likely though, it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain uh, due to you inverting your ankle the other day. Uhm, what we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some NSAIDS like Advil for pain to help you. And it should it should get better on its own, with some physiotherapy later on as well. However, if we find that on physical examination you are having significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain, we might also require you to get an X Ray of the right foot and ankle, as well as just your lower leg. So yeah, we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an X Ray.","OK, that sounds good, thank you."
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"I just came in here today, I've been having a lot of shoulder pain that's just kind of left me not doing any of my activities recently. Just in my left shoulder."
musculoskeletal,"OK and when, when did this pain start?","It started 5 days ago but it became pretty bad and I've been kind of having like a somewhat of a pain for the last couple weeks, but it got really bad just this week."
musculoskeletal,"OK, did you have any trauma to the shoulder like any any injuries or triggers that could have caused the pain?",Uhm I have been just going to the gym more frequently over the last few months and lifting weights and things like that. But just this week I wasn't even really able to do that either.
musculoskeletal,"OK, when you were lifting weights like a few days ago like was there an episode where there was an acute onset of the pain, where it got worse kind of like right away.","I think it was more progressive, but five days ago I do feel that there was like just. I was having some pain before that, but then I just noticed while working on I I started having more pain. But yeah I don't think there was anything like sudden that happened though."
musculoskeletal,"Oh OK, but it yeah it was progressing and then it got acutely worse with the weight lifting. It sounds like.",Maybe like I did increase my weight like in the last two weeks. So I did feel like a little bit more pain with the increase last week.
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see an in the left shoulder do you feel the pain at the front at the sides or or back?","It hurts, particularly like in the front part of the shoulder."
musculoskeletal,"OK, do you feel that it's radiating anywhere else?","Just my whole left shoulder, nothing else really."
musculoskeletal,"OK. And could you describe the character or the quality of the pain? Is it sharp, or is it a key?",It's more achy.
musculoskeletal,OK.,But but certain like some movements so it can get like kind of sharp.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and has there been anything that has made the pain worse?","Uhm, if I just if I carry anything with my left arm or if I have to lift anything or place it on my shoulder like it really hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and have you done anything that's made it better?","I just like resting it, not carrying anything. And trying not to lie on my shoulder."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so you're sleeping on the others on the right side then.",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"OK alright, how would what would you say the severity of the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10.","Uhm, if I'm not doing it, doing anything or not doing much, it's probably like a two or three, but if I try to carry anything it goes up to like probably like a 7."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uh, and um. Do you do any repetitive kind of like overhead activities? Things like playing basketball or just lifting things like above your head at the gym?","Um not recently just just like normal weight exercise, maybe with the bands I do some overhead exercises, but in terms of sports I I play or I used to play a lot of tennis. I did have some issues with the same shoulder, which is why I kind of stopped playing tennis. My doctor said it, I might have overused that shoulder, but that's that was like a couple of years back so I thought it must have healed by now."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so previous overuse injury of the left shoulder?",Mmmm
musculoskeletal,"OK, and uh. I'm have you had any trauma to the shoulder?",Um no not that I know of.
musculoskeletal,"OK, have you had any fevers or chills?",No.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?",Um nope.
musculoskeletal,OK. And um. How has your sleep been these past couple of nights? So you mentioned you haven't been able to lay on your left side?,"Yeah, it's been pretty painful like I kind of wake up every time I accidentally go on to my left side."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so you're getting worse thing a pain at night?",Yup.
musculoskeletal,OK. Have you had any weakness? Do you feel like you have less strength in your arm?,"Um I do you feel that there might be some less strength in my left arm, but it's I'm not really using it much so it's hard to tell."
musculoskeletal,"OK,  And how about a range of motion. Do you feel as though you could lift your left arm up to like, scratch your head and back?",It does hurt like when I try to lift my arm up.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so it sounds like a range of motion is decreased?",Mmm
musculoskeletal,"OK, and have you had any altered sensation of your arms being like numbness or tingling?","No, I haven't felt any of that."
musculoskeletal,OK. Um and have you had any changes to your bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea?,"Nope, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,Have you had any abdominal pain?,Nope.
musculoskeletal,And have you had any urinary problems?,No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?","Uh. No, I've been a pretty healthy actually just just that overuse injury like two years ago."
musculoskeletal,"OK, great and do you have any allergies to medications?",No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, do you take any medications regularly?","Just recently I've been taking a lot more of the Advil, but that's about it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries?","No, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations."

musculoskeletal,No. OK. How about smoking cigarettes or cannabis?,"No, I've never smoked."
musculoskeletal,Do you use any recreational drugs or have you in the past?,Nope
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um. And so so the next part, just for the physical exam. So do you have pain with shoulder AB duction.","Uhm yes. So just to yeah, I do have some pain. Especially from. Yeah yeah pain throughout AB duction."
musculoskeletal,"OK, is there any like pain that's like parts of that that range of motion that are more painful for you?","yeah, so probably from 60 degrees to 120 degrees is more painful."
musculoskeletal,OK. And. If your arm is outstretched and your thumb pointing down so your arm is internally rotated does that give you pain?,"Yeah, if yeah, not not just like that, but if you were to like press down on it it the internal rotation does cause a little bit of pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, so it sounds like a positive jobes test and a positive Neer's test as well as a painful arc for your shoulder. And is there pain to palpation?","Uh. Just to, yeah, definitely just at the front of the shoulder there is some some pain over with palpation."
musculoskeletal,"OK, that sensation is normal, reflexes are normal and strength is slightly reduced as well. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check on the physical exam as well. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention today that I maybe forgot?","No, I think that's it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, um so based onI know that the symptoms today along with your age and prior history of an overuse injury of the left shoulder, it certainly raises concern of having a rotator cuff tear or um a rotator cuff impingement syndrome and where there is inflammation there not necessarily actually a full tear of the muscle that's causing the pain. So, uh, those would be the two most likely things. Yeah, their rotator cuff tear or subacromial impingement syndrome. And so we were going to get an ultrasound of the left shoulder to evaluate the structures and possibly some other imaging such as an X Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury in the left shoulder.","OK, sounds good. Thank you."
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"Hi, I've I've had um this pain in my left knee that's been going on now for the last uh three or four months um but it's gotten a bit a bit worse, it used to only really bug me while I was doing activity, and now its started to uh hurt even more um afterwards as well, so I'm getting the pain at at rest. and so I wanted to come and get that checked out."
musculoskeletal,"OK yeah, for sure. Um and you said it started a few weeks ago?","Uh well, I think it first started a few months ago, but in the past couple of weeks it has started to um kinda like last longer and and happen at rest as well."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, and so does anything make it worse or better? I assume doing any sort of physical activity makes it worse and rest makes it better, but how about anything other than that?","Uhm not really, yeah, it's mostly just the the activity, if I'm going upstairs or um downstairs or uh during running is really where it hurts the most and that's what's bugged me the um yeah, the most, running."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say sharp, dull, achy, crampy?","Uh it's a sharp pain, uh almost like every time my foot hits the ground I get like a sharp stabbing pain and while I'm at at rest it feels a bit more dull, while, yeah, yeah while I'm at rest."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, and 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is this pain?",A six.
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright, and have you ever experienced this type of pain before?","Uh I did have something similar like many years ago. I used to be a rower uh in undergrad and I got some similar pains before, and I mean with some stretching and um other I don't know kind of strengthening stuff, it it kind of helped but I didn't go see anybody for it at that time because it it kind of went away after a little while,"
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, um and you said you were, are you still rowing?","No, no, the only activity that I'm doing now is is running."
musculoskeletal,"Running, OK and from when it started to now, in the past couple of weeks has it changed like dramatically, um is it affecting your day to day life?","Uh a little bit, yeah, like even now, just walking I can I can feel it. Um the pain's not as severe but like as when I'm running but I can, I'm starting to notice it uh daily."

musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, and how about when you palpate uh that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps?","That feels OK, no pain in the muscles."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about like the patellar tendon?",Uh no pain there.
musculoskeletal,"OK. And then when you go lower below your kneecap, um when you palpate like the top part where the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula are, do you feel any pain there?","Uh, yeah, no pain there."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?","Uh, yeah, I am."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?","It is, yeah it's, I get a sharp pain if, when doing that."
musculoskeletal,"OK yeah, uhm how about when you um sit back down, does that hurt?","Um yeah, that hurts too."
musculoskeletal,"That hurts too, OK. Um and then how about when you flex your knee inwards, um so that your heel is touching your bum like does that hurt?","Uh like I, I'll get up, uh no that doesn't hurt, that feels OK."
musculoskeletal,"OK, how about when you extend your knee back out, straighten it all the way?","Yeah, that feels OK too if I'm just sitting and doing that, I can um, I can do that OK."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um how about when you, so you're standing and then you uh you abduct your hip so you basically, um you flex your hip but laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it's almost, so that your your, the action is like you're uh trying to touch the ceiling.","OK yeah I um, it, if, it does feel, it feels like it's kind of pulling um like it feels tight when I do that uh like on that side, it's, I don't get the same sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable."
musculoskeletal,"OK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?",Yep.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk. Um so I'm gonna get you to adduct your thigh, so bring it back towards you, the the median, um as far as possible.","Oh yeah, I can't really, it's kind of like stuck out there. It feels really tight if I'm trying to like bring it, bring it back down, my leg almost like floats up if I just leave it there."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point. Does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,How may I help you?,"I just came in here today, I usually don't come to the doctor that much unless I absolutely need it. Five days ago I started having this pain and swelling in my right knee. So and at first I thought it was just like my arthritis acting up but it's been getting more swollen and painful than usual, so I just wanted to come in and check it out."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so when did you first notice that this pain, like when did it get more swollen and painful than usual?",So like I would say around 5 days ago it started getting more and usually I do get pain in some of my joints but I I don't really get swelling so that was a bit different.

musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly so right now the top thing on top two things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that, including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it. However, you also had a knee injection a week ago, which could predispose to an infection. So gout and septic arthritis are the two things that I am thinking about an, so we'll do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment.","OK, sounds good."

musculoskeletal,"OK, so next I just wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm. Compared to the other side, are you noticing any swelling, redness, or?","Yeah, any swelling or redness, I do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area, some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in that region. Uhm, I also feel like when I like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards."
musculoskeletal,"OK, is this the mass or lump that I you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm?",Yeah yeah.
musculoskeletal,"OK, is there any temperature change, like does it feel warm on that side?",Uhm I can't really tell if it's warm or not.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up, or is a range of motion limited?","It's pretty limited. It's pretty tough to flex. It's really painful and that I also can't like. I can't turn my arm, I can't supinate."
musculoskeletal,"OK so yeah, so is that so you have reduced supination as well?",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"And how are your shoulder movement, are you able to like if you're lifting your arms straight out in front of you, are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head?",Out like at the sides or in front of me?
musculoskeletal,In front of you.,"Yeah, the shoulder seems to be OK. I am able to lift up, but it's just if I try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright so. You'll get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement.","There there is discomfort in the affected side, but I can I can move it much more than I can move my elbows or anything like that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, I see. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and I look for on on the physical today. Was there anything I may be missed or anything like that?","Uhm no I think, uh, I don't have any other questions."
musculoskeletal,"OK, alright, so based on the history and what you're telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps, tendon tear or biceps tendon injury. And having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow flexion, they all suggests that there is a biceps, tendon tear, or injury there, and so will want to get an ultrasound or MRI to look at will start with the ultrasound, but then possibly get an MRI as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage, but if there is just a long head of biceps tear, it will usually be treated conservatively. And so we'll just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is.",OK.
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,"Hi, yesterday I was grocery shopping and, yeah, just in the parking lot somebody bumped into my car and this morning I woke up and my neck is just really painful. It hurt yesterday a little bit, but I mean it was so mild I didn't think much of it. But today it's it's quite a bit worse."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so can you tell me how this accident happened? Were you sitting in the passenger seat and the driver? And was the impact from like behind at the back of your car or at the front?","It was at the back so I was the driver and was just going over a speed bump in the parking lot so slowed down quite a bit and the person behind me must not have, and they bumped into me. There's just some scratches on the bumper. They didn't hit too hard, but I, I guess maybe hard enough."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and did the neck pain start immediately after?","Uh no it's I, like not immediately, yeah, I think it started a bit later on and then worse a bit, a bit today."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Alright, and is there pain anywhere else on your body?","Uh really like my. No, just just really, my neck."
musculoskeletal,"OK. OK, and does anything feel broken? Do, are there bruises anywhere? Any obvious signs of trauma?","No, I canât, I didn't notice anything like that and I can move my neck around so I don't think any I donât, I don't think anything is broken. Just hurts a lot."
musculoskeletal,"Alright, and is a pain constantly there or does it come and go?","It kind of comes and goes, it just it's worse with movement. If I just kinda sit still, I don't notice much pain, but if I'm betting my head forward or. Mostly backwards, so I'll get, I'll get pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and you said this happened yesterday, right?","Yeah yeah, this happened yesterday afternoon."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um and does anything make this better? Like have you tried ice, say any topicals any positions that that helps with the pain?","I did try some like Advil last night, but like when I when the pain was coming on and it must've helped me sleep I guess, but I haven't tried any ice or anything like that, just mostly I guess resting."
musculoskeletal,OK so you said the pain is at the back of the neck does it radiate anywhere up into your head or down into your shoulders or lower or upper back?,"Uhm. Maybe a little bit to the upper back, like when I like trap, trapezius, muscle area, or the traps like it if I push on those muscles around that area, I do get a little bit of tenderness."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, and if you were to describe the quality of this pain, would you say it's sharp, dull, achy, throbbing? Uhm, how would you describe it?","I would say it's sharp. Yeah, especially if I do any movements like it'll be feels like I mean, it stabbed in the neck."

musculoskeletal,"OK. And do you feel like it's getting worse, the pain since it started yesterday?","Yeah, it could be that at first I didn't even have any pain at all. Maybe it was just the adrenaline pumping or whatever, but now I can notice the pain."

musculoskeletal,And the front? OK. And then how about when you extend your head all the way back so that you're looking at the ceiling?,"Iâm able to do it still is a bit stiff and it's slow to get there, but again I I get pain at the back in the front of my neck when I'm doing this."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, how about when you flex your neck to the side so that your right ear is touching your right shoulder?","Um yeah, I get there's a little bit of a pain in the muscles on the left side when I'm doing that"
musculoskeletal,"OK, and then how about when you do the opposite? Touch your left ear to your left shoulder so that you're laterally flexing your neck on the left side?","A little bit of pain there too, but I'm able to do it though."
musculoskeletal,"OK. So you're able to do all of these, it's just that you have some pain when you do that?","Yeah, exactly, I could do all of the movements, but yeah, it's pain and stiffness."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?","Uh no, that I just was wondering if I if you think I I donât, needed an X Ray or like you think that anything is broken. Kind of like concerned about today, because of this pain."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah. And for sure, um so right now it just to me it sounds like a whiplash injury and so kind of like low impact. But just to be certain, we can order an X Ray to rule out any fractures or dislocations. And in terms of like the management plan, for pain management you can rest, you can either apply heat or cold packs to your neck for 15 minutes every couple of hours or so. You can try some over the counter pain medications like Ibuprofen or Tylenol. And if it still doesn't get better, we can try like, we can try injections to the area to relieve some of that pain, but something else in conjunction we can try as physiotherapy and they'll basically help you with. Range of motion exercises and try to strengthen the muscles in that area and to improve your posture and normal movement. And that's kind of where we can start for now. And if it doesn't get any better, we can talk about alternative management plans, does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, that that makes sense. Thank you."

musculoskeletal,"No OK, and is there any like muscle atrophy around the hip?","No, not that I see at all."
musculoskeletal,OK and then is there any misalignment or deformity of the joints that you can see?,"No, I can't. Yeah, I don't see anything in the hips or legs that really points out to me."
musculoskeletal,OK um and is there any pain to palpation over the hip or or knee?,"Uh, if I if I press on it, I don't think she's in that much pain. It's mainly just when she's trying to walk or put put weight on it."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and is she able to move the hip in a full range of motion of like flexion, and extension, abduction, adduction?","Uhm, so she does. She is able to move it if she really tries. But it's mainly just the putting her weight on it and anytime she puts her weight on it is is when it really hurts."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so more about the weight on it, and is she able to move that her knee with a full range of motion?",Yeah.
musculoskeletal,"OK, and any any muscle weakness when testing around the joint?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. So I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on history and check was there anything I maybe forgot about you thought would be more important today,",No I think that's all just just was wondering what might be going on?
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, certainly, so a couple of things that it could be. One is that it can be common in this age group is something called transient synovitis. Where, which can happen in the hip where there's some inflammation and it causes some pain following a viral infection. And it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough, fever and and runny nose and her. She was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well, which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature, pointing towards transient synovitis, which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti- inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen, but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint, but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. And, but this would be more of progressive  onset, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red hot swollen joint, then we'd be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess.","OK, sounds good. Thank you so much."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, so for a few months, stiffness in the morning. So your back hurts, where exactly would you say it hurts?","It kinda hurts all over. I can't really pinpoint any specific locations that hurts most, kind of hurts like all down my my back."
musculoskeletal,"OK, all the way up to I guess your neck and all the way down to your lower back?","So I wouldn't really say the neck, and I guess more of the the lower parts. Maybe like the middle of my back and..."
musculoskeletal,I see.,And down.
musculoskeletal,"Ok and what kind of pain would you say it is, is it like a dull aching pain? Is it a sharp stabbing pain? How would you describe it?",It's a dull pain.
musculoskeletal,"Dull pain, ok. Ok, and on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the least amount of pain you felt in your life and 10 being the worst, how much would you rate it?","It's about a four or five. I mean some days it can be better, but yeah, some days it can be worse."
musculoskeletal,OK and when did this start?,"I think this started about like four or five months ago. It's been going on, yeah, for probably about half a year now."
musculoskeletal,"OK, and when it first started up, was there anything that caused the back pain? Like any kind of trauma or injury, anything that you can think of that might have led to this?","No, nothing that it's I I can think of. It's sort of it's come on so slowly like when I first started noticing the back pain it it was maybe like a 0 to a one. I didn't really notice it too much, but over these last 5, 6 months it has gotten has gotten a bit worse."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, so it kind of came on progressively. Didn't just come on suddenly at some point?","Right, yeah, it's been getting worse."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and have you ever had any previous episodes that are similar to this?","Uh, not not in my back pain. I do get pain in my right knee and in my hands sometimes. But those pains just kind of come and go."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and when did those pains start?","Uhm, those ones started, probably similar timeline around six months ago."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, ok. And in the back pain that you're having, does it radiate or move to any other part of your body?","No, I don't feel it anywhere else."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and have you tried anything that has helped relieve some of the pain? Any medications or anything?","Yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil, and that the Advil is actually helped taking the edge off a little bit, but the next morning I I have the stiffness and and pain again."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and for your pain, are there any kind of factors that make the pain worse, like bending down or standing straight up or laying down anything that makes your pain worse?",Uh no nothing that I can think of that really makes it any worse.
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and is your pain worse when you wake up in the morning or is it worse as the day progresses?","It's worse in the morning. It gets a bit better as the day goes on. I asked about it, an hour into the day, I feel my best. It takes a little bit of time to to move around a little bit first."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, approximately how much time would you say after you wake up, the stiffness and pain goes away?",I would say maybe 30 to 60 minutes.
musculoskeletal,"Ok, alright. And no, you haven't had any trauma injuries in recently, right?",No trauma or injuries.
musculoskeletal,Ok and no fevers or chills?,No.
musculoskeletal,"Ok, any night sweats?",No.
musculoskeletal,Any fatigue or malaise?,"Yeah, I have been a bit more fatigued than usual, and yeah, I I've had some malaise as well."

musculoskeletal,"Ok, any muscle weakness at all?","Nope, I haven't noticed any muscle weakness."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and have you been sick at all recently with any viral or bacterial infections?","Um I had a uh, and then I was diarrhea like several months ago and I had some antibiotics, but that was a yeah, so a few months ago."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and other than that, currently are you sexually active?","Yes I am uh I I have a girlfriend then we've, uh, we started dating about about, uh, six months ago."

musculoskeletal,"Ok, alright and is your partner fine or is she having any symptoms at all?","No, she she hasn't been having any symptoms then we we've been using a condom mostly."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, alright and otherwise are you generally healthy or do you have any medical conditions?","Uhm, yeah, I'm I'm generally alright.

musculoskeletal,Ok and you drink alcohol?,"Sometimes, yeah, I'll have a beer or two on weekends or or a cocktail with friends."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, alright, so those were just some of the questions I had. Now I'm just going to quickly uh, ask some specific questions. So have you noticed any kind of swelling in the areas that you are having pain or redness or anything like that?","Uhm no, I haven't noticed really any any uh redness or or swelling"
musculoskeletal,"OK and no so, are you able to bend down and stand up straight or extend backwards so without pain or are you in any pain?","Uhm, I do get it. It's a bit stiff. Uhm I, uh, yeah, I'm not really too sure it's like, not really, it's more more more stiff."
musculoskeletal,"Ok, and yeah, other than that, do you have any questions or concerns?","Uhm, yeah, I was just wondering, yeah, like like what what this could be possibly?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so definitely what so this this seems like it started off like 3 months or six months ago, and it's been going on and it's happening in the morning. And how old did you say you were?",Uhm I'm 26.
musculoskeletal,"OK, yeah, so uh, it seems progressive and you're getting some pain in your other joints as well and it's mainly from your middle to lower back. It can be multiple things that we would have to rule out. So you first you have a family history of psoriasis so it can be psoriatic arthritis. You don't have any other skins, changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a you were sick for months ago with a what might be gastroenteritis. It can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called reactive arthritis - where you get this progressive pain in your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called ankylosing spondylitis, which can present in men your age and it's kind of like a progressive, dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment or for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well, as well as a X Ray of the of the spine and your sacroiliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibodies. Those are just some things that will test for different kind of rheumatological issues and to see if you have any arthritis. So yeah those are and then will also get an X Ray of your hands and knees since you're having pain there as well. So yeah, those are some steps that we'll take. Do you have any questions or concerns?","No, that that sounds, that sounds great, thank you."
musculoskeletal,"Alright, yeah, so I will get in touch with you shortly.","Sounds great, thank you."
musculoskeletal,"Alright, take care.",Bye.

musculoskeletal,"OK, and where about specifically?","Kind of just, yeah, on the lower uh lower right side like more on the, more on the right side."
musculoskeletal,"More on the right side, OK. Now, if you have a mirror with you, or if you have someone there with you who can um speak to this, does your right side appear more red, swollen, or hot compared to your left side of the lower back?","Uh no, nothing like that."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK, and does it seem like it's more atrophied or do you see any deformities or skin changes in that area?","Uh nope, no deformities or skin changes."
musculoskeletal,"OK, um alright and I'm gonna get you to um bend down all the way and touch your toes if you can.",Um yeah I I can get part part way down.
musculoskeletal,"You can get partway down, does it hurt?","Um a little bit, I can feel it pulling and stretching, yeah."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um alright, and then I'm gonna get you to uh like laterally flex to your right side. So kind of like you're doing an exercise um and you're just like bending towards that side.","Yeah, that hurts."
musculoskeletal,"That hurts, OK, how about the other side, the left side?",Yeah that hurts too.
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um and now I wanna get you to uh bring your knees up towards the ceiling. Does that hurt? One at a time, like your right right knee and your left knee.","Uh, not really."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK, how about when you um flex your knees backwards?",Nope.
musculoskeletal,And kind of point your knees towards the ground.,"No, no pain there."

musculoskeletal,"OK, OK, good um and, OK so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?","Uh, no I was just uh yeah, kind of wondering do I do I need any X Rays or like what what what's going on?"
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, so um what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain. It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up. Um yeah, did you have any questions or does that sound like an OK plan?",Uh that sounds like a good plan.
musculoskeletal,What brings you in?,I've um I've been having this numbness and tingling and I guess kind of burning sensation that well uh it's been happening more often in my uh left hand.
musculoskeletal,"On your left hand, OK. And sorry when did you say this started?",Uh it's been going on for probably four or five months um.
musculoskeletal,OK.,"Yeah, it first uh it would only bug me for a couple of minutes at a time and I could kind of shake my hand out, like flick like flick my wrist and um and it would go away after a few minutes. But now I'm starting to get uh like symptoms at night sometimes as well."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so um it's gotten worse then, you said over the past few weeks?",Yeah it has.
musculoskeletal,OK um and is it always there? Is it persistent or does it come and go?,It comes and goes.
musculoskeletal,OK and what makes it better or worse?,"Uh better uh I've tried some um Advil um and Tylenol and it's kind of the, hasn't done much um for the pain really, uh I think only the thing that kind of helps it is just not using it as much, um yeah."
musculoskeletal,"Yeah, alright, um have you tried any like cold compresses, um topical creams? Anything like that?",No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. And uhm if you were to describe the quality of how it feels like, does it does it, is it painful, is it tender, or is it just numb and tingling, kind of like when your foot goes to sleep?","Uh I guess I have, it is a bit painful as well, yeah. I have um like a burning kind of pain."
musculoskeletal,"OK and 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain ever, how bad is this pain?","Uh when it gets to its worst, I would say about a 6."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. Um and have you ever experienced this before or is this kind of like the first time you're experiencing this?","Yeah, this is the first uh really like over these last three months, the first time I've been experiencing it, I think uh the first time that it started it started to wake me up at night though has been like about a couple of weeks ago."

musculoskeletal,"OK, alright good, um so now we're just going to move on to the physical exam part um of this interview. Um so I'm going to get you to look at both your arms, hands, and wrists, um side by side. Does your left one seem at all more red, swollen, uh or hot.","No, no symptoms like that."
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. And um do you, does that one seem to be more atrophied or are there any deformities or skin changes on that one?","Um maybe uh a little less muscle bulk on the, like where my thumb is."
musculoskeletal,"OK, OK. Um and then I'm gonna get you to palpate certain areas of that arm. So let's start um at the top, when you when you press down on your shoulder blades or just at the very top of your um arm where your, or at the very top where your arm connects to your shoulder, does it hurt over there?","No, no pain there."
musculoskeletal,OK. So no pain on the acromion process or the scapula. Um any pain where your biceps are?,No.
musculoskeletal,"No, OK. How about at your elbows?","Uh no pain at the elbows and full, I can move my elbows and shoulders, uh no problem either. And my neck doesn't hurt at all either, I can move my neck around."
musculoskeletal,"How about when you um palpate your wrists, both sides, medial and lateral?","Uh, yeah no, no pain if I'm just pressing or palpating the wrist."
musculoskeletal,"OK. Um and I'm going to get you to um straighten out your arm and flex at your shoulder and extend at your shoulder, does that hurt?",No.
musculoskeletal,How about when you flex your elbow and extend your elbow?,No.
musculoskeletal,Um how about when you flex your wrist and extend your wrist?,No.
musculoskeletal,"OK, so I'm going to do a special test for something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um so um I'm gonna get you to straighten out your left arm again um and right where um alright, how do we do this? OK, so with your right hand or with your yeah, with your right index finger and middle finger, you're going to tap um just below uh where the bulk of your thumb muscles are um connecting to your wrist. I'm just going to get you to tap that area. Do you feel tingling like an electric shock sensation in your hand or anything like that.","I do, yeah."
musculoskeletal,"You do, OK, so that's a positive Tinel's sign. Um and then we're going to do one more test, so I'm going to, OK so make like a prayer motion with your hands like um putting your 2 palms together and then um and then instead invert your hand so that the outer parts are touching and your fingers are pointing towards the ground.",OK.
musculoskeletal,"So kind of like upside down but with your outer parts of your hands touching. Um and then I'm going to get you to uh just hold your arms like that um for about 60 seconds. Do you feel any tingling, numbness, or pain in those fingers?","Yeah, I get a bit of uh numbness and tingling when when I do that."
musculoskeletal,"OK, so that's a positive Phalen's sign test. Um alright, so that brings me to the end of um this interview, did you have any questions or concerns, anything that you wanted to bring up?",Uh just wondering about um what this could be.
musculoskeletal,"Oh yeah, so um it seems like you have something called carpal tunnel syndrome. Um and that is, it's pretty common um so it can be caused by um a lot of things, but basically your median nerve runs through your forearm into your wrist, and anything that squeezes or irritates that median nerve can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, um and some things include um like repetitive movements at work, um obesity, um any nerve damaging conditions like diabetes, um inflammatory conditions, but mostly just like workplace factors can can do it, um especially if you're working with like vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires like repetitive and prolonged flexing of the wrist. Um so uh diagnosis, we just do that through like symptoms, physical exam, um we don't really need to do any imaging at this at this point. And to treat it um basically work modification, so taking frequent breaks, uh not doing those repetitive movements um as often um and then you can do things at home, like apply cold packs. Um and then we also have some like non-surgical treatments where we can uh splint, we can put like a wrist splint um while you sleep to relieve those nighttime symptoms. Uh you can take some NSAIDs to relieve pain, um and if those don't work, we can try corticosteroids, um and if that doesn't work, then we can also discuss surgery sometime down the line. Does that sound OK?","It does, yeah, thank you."
